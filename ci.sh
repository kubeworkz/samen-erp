# The PERMANENT D8 CI tier — a keyless, deterministic runtime eval of the AI plane, wired
# as a first-class ROOT-gate step (like the samen_core suite / the demo verifier gate) so a
# mask leak or an eval regression FAILS THE ROOT GATE. Two standing gates run here:
#   (1) the mask-leak RED-TEAM (RP-AI-7, ADR-043 §10.2) — full-DB vault CANARY seeding
#       (real Factory vault writes, two orgs) fired through EVERY AI egress surface (the six
#       T68 verbs, the T69 MCP tools, the T70 support operator, the T71 CRM + analytics
#       surfaces, the T67 embeddings plane) asserting ZERO canary plaintext + ZERO vt_ token
#       reaches ANY egress class EG1–EG6 (provider recording, vector store, captured logs,
#       telemetry events, rendered errors, MCP responses, persisted drafts) — plus cross-org
#       isolation and the §3.2a multi-turn expired-grant re-mask (RP-AI-10);
#   (2) the grounding-context EVAL (ADR-043 §10.1) — the committed ≥20-case corpus asserted
#       at the AUTHORITATIVE ≥90% context-assembly bar (an assembly-not-fidelity bar, §10).
# Keyless (Provider.Fake / Embedder.Deterministic) + deterministic — no flake, because a
# flaky permanent gate is a real red; SAMEN_AI_LIVE=1 is the sole live lane, never in CI.
# Sabotage-refutable at the TIER level (scripts/sabotages/53-*): a value-layer mask leak
# flips the NAMED EG1 red-team test in this exact `mix test test/ai_eval/` run, proving the
# TIER fails, not merely a unit test. samen_core's own `mix test` above also loads these
