  # samen_web — the FRAMEWORK UI library (ADR-009). It promotes the inherited-80%
  # product UI (the component kit + the CRM/Billing/Support LiveViews + the two-plane
  # masking) out of the driftwood-local `driftwood_web` and into a shared path-dep lib
  # that EVERY vertical inherits by mounting, not by copying 11 LiveViews.
  #
  # It depends on phoenix_live_view/phoenix_html/phoenix (the web deps) + samen_core
  # (the pure kernel, path dep). samen_core gains NO web dep — the web dep lives HERE,
  # so the kernel's 842-test suite + verifier gate stay green by construction.
  #
  # In :test it ships its OWN test-support host (Samen.WebTest.{Repo,Crm,Billing,Support})
  # so the render tests exercise real materialized scope resources with NO dependency on
  # any vertical — the two-plane masking guarantee is proven by a framework-local test.
