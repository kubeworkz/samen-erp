defmodule Samen.Web.ChatUnfurlMaskingTest do
  @moduledoc """
  THE CROWN-JEWEL GATE (ADR-012 §7 red paths 1 + 2, test-plan §8.2).

  Resolve the SAME `samen:crm.person:<id>` ref as a TENANT (plane :tenant) and as an OPERATOR
  (plane :operator) and assert:

    * red path 1 — the tenant card shows the REAL name/email/phone; the operator card shows
      `••••` for the SAME object, with the plaintext ABSENT and no `vt_`/`pii_` token; and
    * red path 2 — a `samen:crm.person:<id>` for a DIFFERENT org's row resolves to
      `{:error, :not_found}` (an inert "not available" chip), no existence oracle, no leak.

  The resolver is a COMPOSITION of two kernel gates (OrgScope + PiiResolution) over the host's
  own resource — so this test proves masking BY CONSTRUCTION, not a chat trick. The SAME
  capability is reusable anywhere (chat is the first consumer, not the owner).
