  ADR-047 A5 — the tenant + operator agent SURFACES.

  Tenant plane (`Samen.Web.AI.AgentLive`):

    * the run list + per-run detail render with JS off (ADR-042 Class B);
    * **org scope** — a run in another org does not exist for this surface (RP-AG-10:
      no row, no existence oracle);
    * **honesty copy driven by the persisted state**, never by a promoted last turn:
      `:budget_exhausted` says *this is not a partial answer*; `:expired` says the
      proposal lapsed and nothing executed; `:rejected` / `:failed` / `:cancelled` each
      render their own honest terminal (ADR-014 / ADR-047 §6);
    * the SIMULATED badge is driven by the turn row's persisted `simulated` flag
      (stamped at the chokepoint from `%Completion{}.simulated`), never parsed from text;
    * **cancel** goes through the kernel's org-scoped `Samen.AI.Agent.cancel/2` and says
      "stopping after the current step", never "stopped";
    * the **decision card** renders TOKEN-ONLY provenance (tool kind, turn index, arg key
      NAMES, args digest) and never an argument value, and the decide handler REFUSES an
      approval id that is not this run's pending proposal — re-read from the server on
      every click rather than trusted from the last render.

  Operator plane (`Samen.Web.Operator.AgentHealthLive` / `Samen.AI.Agent.Health`):

    * per-definition aggregates + the bounded run/turn log;
    * the **durable per-{org, definition} kill** is role-gated (readonly may view, never
      manage), narrowed to one tenant (the A2/A3 cross-tenant blast radius is closed),
      and only an explicit re-arm clears it.

  ## What is deliberately proven in samen_core instead

  The full click-to-EXECUTE path (a real `apv_approval` row, requester ≠ approver at the
  DB CHECK, the args-digest binding, approver-membership resolution, execution inside the
  decision transaction) is proven against the REAL engine in
  `samen_core/test/ai/agent_write_test.exs`; samen_web's scratch host mounts no approvals
  resource. This surface adds no second decision path — `AgentReads.decide/3` is a
  pass-through — so what is proven here is the surface's own contract: what it renders,
  and what it refuses to send to the engine.
