defmodule Samen.Web.Marketing.Reads do
  @moduledoc """
  The framework Marketing / outreach read + write layer (ADR-011 §7). Reads the host's
  materialized Marketing scope resources through `Samen.Web.Mount.resource/2` — the same
  host-parameterization seam CRM uses, so the same code reads Driftwood's Marketing inside
  Driftwood and PawChart's inside PawChart with no host module named here.

  All reads go through Ash so `OrgScope` + vault masking apply.

  ## The 🔒 PII surface — Subscriber.email

  `Subscriber.email` is vault-routed PII resolved through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4`,
  exactly like CRM `Person.emails`:

    * TENANT plane — the org reads its OWN subscribers' email in CLEAR (it owns them + may
      email them);
    * OPERATOR / impersonation plane — the SAME field renders `%Masked{}` (→ ••••). An
      operator viewing a tenant's campaign sees `••••` for every recipient, and the send row
      itself carries NO email (only the opaque `subscriber_id`), so nothing leaks on the
      operator plane by construction.

  ## MASKING INVARIANT

  This module NEVER calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, NEVER pattern-matches a vault token out of
  a `%Masked{}`, and NEVER introduces a "show plaintext" code path. Plaintext reaches the
  LiveView only if the shared `PiiResolution` resolver already resolved it. A resolver failure
  keeps `%Masked{}` (no plaintext downgrade).

  ## Consent / suppression enforcement (the load-bearing red path)

  `enqueue_send/3` is the ONLY send path the outreach UI uses. Suppression is enforced by the
  KERNEL `Send.:create_checked` action — an `OrgScope`-inheriting Ash read of THIS mount's own
  `Suppression` resource (portable across any mount abbrev, ADR-014 §4). We no longer duplicate
  the check here (the old framework `refuse_if_suppressed/3` existed only because the kernel
  hardcoded the demo-abbrev `msp_suppression` table; that hardcode is gone). `create_send/3`
  maps the kernel's suppression refusal back to `{:error, :suppressed}` so the UI still renders
  "suppressed — skipped" per recipient. The consent/status gate (`refuse_if_undeliverable/3`)
  stays — it is a distinct concern (an `:unsubscribed`/`:bounced` subscriber is undeliverable
  even with no suppression row). A refused send writes no send row and enqueues no Oban job;
  a delivered send (1) creates the send via `:create_checked` (which also layers the kernel's
  same-org-FK guard), and (2) enqueues the `Samen.Scopes.Marketing.SendWorker` Oban job with
  TOKEN-ONLY args (`send_id` / `org_id` / `subscriber_id` — never the email).
