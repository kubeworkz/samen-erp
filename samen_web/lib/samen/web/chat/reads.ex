defmodule Samen.Web.Chat.Reads do
  @moduledoc """
  The framework read layer for chat (ADR-012 §6.1) — every function reads the host's
  materialized Chat resources through Ash (so `OrgScope` narrows to the viewer's org) and
  resolves every PII field through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution` for the scope's plane (tenant
  clear / operator `••••`). The SAME discipline as `Samen.Web.CRM.Reads`.

  ## MASKING INVARIANT

  This module NEVER calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, NEVER pattern-matches a vault token out of a
  `%Masked{}`, and NEVER introduces a "show plaintext" code path. Plaintext only reaches the
  LiveView if the resolver already resolved it through the shared chokepoint for the viewer's
  plane. A resolver failure keeps `%Masked{}` (no plaintext downgrade). This is why the
  id-only PubSub envelope (ADR-012 §3.1) is safe: each subscriber re-reads through THIS layer
  with its OWN scope, so the body resolves per the RECEIVING viewer's plane — a masked
  operator session cannot obtain plaintext even by listening on the topic.

  Note the read functions take the HOST namespace off the `mount` (never a hardcoded host
  module), so the SAME code reads driftwood's chat inside driftwood and pawchart's inside
  pawchart.
