defmodule Samen.Web.Billing.Reads do
  @moduledoc """
  The framework Billing read layer for the inherited Billing pages
  (overview, invoices, plans).

  Promoted from the driftwood-local `Driftwood.BillingReads` (ADR-009 §3.3): resource +
  repo come from `Samen.Web.Mount`, so the SAME code reads Driftwood's Billing inside
  Driftwood and PawChart's Billing inside PawChart. PII fields on the Billing `Customer`
  (billing_name / billing_email) are resolved through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4`:

    * `plane: :tenant`  → CLEAR (the org reads its own customers);
    * `plane: :operator` → `%Masked{}` (→ ••••) by construction.

  ## A3 read-bounding (WS-A design §1.1 "read! elimination")

  Every list page reads through a `*_page/3` built on `Samen.Web.Reads.page!/3`
  (BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION — `limit(page_size + 1)`, hostile page sizes clamped);
  every remaining lookup/join read carries an explicit `limit(#{200})`. Metrics are
  DB aggregates (`Ash.count`/`Ash.sum`) — no row set is transferred, bounded by
  construction.

  ## A3 write side (sanctioned domain actions only)

  The billing blueprint defines `defaults([:read, :destroy, create: :*, update: :*])`
  on every resource; this module only exposes those. Plan / Price / Invoice /
  Subscription writes are ADMIN-gated by the kernel (`RoleAtLeast :admin`), so the
  tenant-plane write path uses `write_scope/2` — a same-org role elevation that
  PRESERVES the plane marker (see the function doc; the elevation can never bypass
  `Samen.Pii.WriteGuard`). Customer writes are member-gated and use the plain scope.

  ## MASKING INVARIANT

  Never calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, never unwraps a `%Masked{}`, never has a
  "show plaintext" branch. Plaintext only reaches the LiveView if the resolver resolved
  it through the shared chokepoint.
