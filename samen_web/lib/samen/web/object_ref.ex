defmodule Samen.Web.ObjectRef do
  @moduledoc """
  The **object-unfurl** framework capability (ADR-012 §4) — the crown jewel. Turns a
  catalogued object reference (`samen:<resource-key>:<id>`) pasted into ANY text into a
  render-ready, **masking-aware-per-viewer** card, by construction.

  This is a STANDALONE framework service — chat is its first consumer, not its owner. A CRM
  detail page can unfurl a related object, an audit log can unfurl an event's subject, a
  notification can unfurl its target. Every vertical inherits object unfurl for every
  catalogued resource, for free.

  ## The ref format

  `samen:<resource-key>:<id>` where `<resource-key>` is the resource-qualified catalog key
  (`crm.person`, `support.ticket`, `billing.invoice`, `freight.driver`) and `<id>` is a
  UUID-shaped id. The key is NOT a raw module name — a paste never leaks `Driftwood.Crm.Person`.
  A bare UUID with no `samen:` prefix is NOT unfurled (the scheme is the explicit opt-in; this
  avoids false positives on arbitrary ids).

  ## Masking BY CONSTRUCTION (the single most important invariant, ADR-012 §1.1)

  `resolve/3` is a COMPOSITION of two kernel gates over the host's OWN resource — it adds no
  new masking code and no new authorization check:

    1. **Load through Ash with the VIEWER'S scope.** `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` narrows the read
       to `scope.actor.org_id`. A ref the viewer's org can't read returns `[]` →
       `{:error, :not_found}` — indistinguishable from a nonexistent id (no cross-org existence
       oracle, no leak). This is the "org-scope the resolve" requirement, satisfied by REUSING
       the kernel policy, not by a bespoke check.
    2. **Resolve PII for the viewer's plane.** `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` rewrites each
       vaulted field to its plane-correct value: the SAME record resolves CLEAR for a
       `plane: :tenant` viewer and `%Masked{}` (→ `••••`) for a `plane: :operator` viewer. This
       is literally the ADR-010 resolver, reused — the per-viewer unfurl-masking property.

  There is NO code path here that reads a column directly, unwraps a `%Masked{}`, calls
  `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, or bypasses `Ash.read`. The card carries the ALREADY-RESOLVED record;
  a `%Masked{}` in any field renders `••••` verbatim through `Phoenix.HTML.Safe`. A resolver
  failure fails SAFE: `{:error, _}` renders an inert chip, never plaintext, never a raise.
