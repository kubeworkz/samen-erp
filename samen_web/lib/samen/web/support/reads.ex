defmodule Samen.Web.Support.Reads do
  @moduledoc """
  The framework Support read layer for the inherited Support pages (tickets, ticket detail).

  Promoted from the driftwood-local `Driftwood.SupportReads` (ADR-009 §3.3): resource + repo
  come from `Samen.Web.Mount`. PII fields:

    * Support `Agent` — full_name (composite vault) + email (scalar vault);
    * Support `Message` — body (scalar vault, free-text);

  resolved through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` (tenant CLEAR / operator ••••).

  ## A3 read-bounding (WS-A design §1.1 "read! elimination")

  The Ticket Inbox reads through the paginated `tickets_page/3` (built on
  `Samen.Web.Reads.page!/3` — BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION); every remaining detail /
  lookup read carries an explicit `limit(#{200})` (single-parent fan-outs, not hot
  lists). Metrics are DB aggregates (`Ash.count`/`Ash.avg`) — no row set transferred.

  ## A3 write side (sanctioned domain actions only)

  The support blueprint defines `defaults([:read, :destroy, create: :*, update: :*])`;
  this module only exposes those: ticket create/delete (member-gated by the kernel),
  the bounded ticket STATUS update, and the message (reply) create — whose vaulted
  `body` rides `Samen.Vault.Change` (MC-2) and is refused to an operator-plane actor
  by `Samen.Pii.WriteGuard` (MC-1) at the Ash write path.

  ## MASKING INVARIANT

  Never calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, never unwraps a `%Masked{}`, never has a
  "show plaintext" branch. Plaintext only reaches the LiveView if the resolver resolved it
  through the shared chokepoint.
