  @moduledoc """
  The router macro a host uses to mount a `samen_web` module's LiveView pages in ~5 lines
  (ADR-009 §3.4).

  `samen_module_routes/3` builds a `Samen.Web.Mount` from the host's `namespace` + `repo`
  + `domain` (three facts; the struct derives resource modules), threads it through a
  `live_session` session, and declares the module's routes. The mount travels in the signed
  session so it is present on both the initial dead render and the websocket reconnect
  (ADR-009 §3.5).

  ## Usage

  The macro expands into `live_session` + `live` declarations, so the host router must have
  `Phoenix.LiveView.Router` imported — which a Phoenix app's `use MyAppWeb, :router` already
  provides (a bare `use Phoenix.Router` needs an explicit `import Phoenix.LiveView.Router`).

      import Samen.Web.Router

      scope "/", DriftwoodWeb do
        pipe_through :browser

        samen_module_routes :crm,     Driftwood.Crm,     repo: Driftwood.Repo
        samen_module_routes :billing, Driftwood.Billing, repo: Driftwood.Repo
        samen_module_routes :support, Driftwood.Support, repo: Driftwood.Repo
      end

  Three lines mount all inherited pages. `plane:` defaults `:tenant`; an operator surface
  passes `plane: :operator` (with `operator_id:` / `target_org_id:`).

  ## Options

    * `:repo`   — REQUIRED. The host's Ecto repo (PiiResolution needs it).
    * `:domain` — the host Ash domain (default: `namespace`).
    * `:plane`  — `:tenant` (default) or `:operator`.
    * `:operator_id` / `:target_org_id` — for the operator plane.
    * `:path`   — the mount path prefix (default `/crm`, `/billing`, `/support`).
    * `:labels` — optional UI copy overrides (workspace title, glyph, crumb root).

  Mount the OPERATOR / SaaS-company control-plane workspace in ONE line (ADR-010 §7.2).

  `namespace` is the host's OPERATOR namespace (a domain that mounted Identity + Billing +
  Support blueprints — e.g. `Driftwood.Operator`). The macro builds ONE operator-plane mount
  (`scope_kind: :operator`) carrying the operator org id in its labels, threads it through a
  `live_session`, and declares all operator routes (Accounts · Platform billing · Revenue ·
  Desk) — a WS-B surface added here (e.g. Revenue, B3) is inherited by every vertical that
  already calls the macro at 0 new LiveView lines (AC-X1).

      import Samen.Web.Router

      scope "/" do
        pipe_through :browser
        samen_operator_routes Driftwood.Operator,
          repo: Driftwood.Repo,
          labels: %{operator_authority: {MyApp.Auth, :operator_role, []}}
      end

  ## Operator-ROLE authorization (T146 — fail CLOSED, by construction)

  Every route this macro declares mounts through an `on_mount`
  (`{Samen.Web.Operator.Authz, :require_operator}`) that derives operator authority from the
  AUTHENTICATED SESSION PRINCIPAL — via the host's `:operator_authority` seam (below) — and
  FAILS CLOSED (redirect to `/login`, renders nothing) for any principal that is NOT an operator.
  A plain authenticated TENANT user therefore cannot reach `/operator/*`. The authority is NEVER
  fabricated from the mount. A host that wires no `:operator_authority` gets NO operator access
  (deny-by-default). See `Samen.Web.Operator.Authz`.

  ## The operator seat's PII plane is `:tenant` of the operator org, NOT `:operator`

  ADR-010 §7.2 (load-bearing): the operator's OWN workspace reads the operator org over its OWN
  book of business on the TENANT plane (clear). The word "operator" names the ORG/WORKSPACE; the
  PII plane is `:tenant`. Only the drill-into-a-tenant action ("Open account") uses
  `plane: :operator` (masked), via the existing `samen_module_routes ... plane: :operator`.

  ## Options

    * `:repo`            — REQUIRED. The host's Ecto repo.
    * `:domain`          — the host Ash domain (default: `namespace`).
    * `:operator_org_id` — the well-known operator org id (else resolved via app env or the
      single seeded Org row — see `Samen.Web.Operator.org_id/1`).
    * `:operator_authority` — the operator-ROLE seam (T146): an `{mod, fun, args}` MFA called
      with the authenticated principal id APPENDED, returning an operator role
      (`Samen.OperatorPlane.Actor.roles/0`) or `nil`. ABSENT → deny-by-default (no operator
      access). See `Samen.Web.Operator.Authz`; a dev-only default is
      `{Samen.Web.Operator.Authz, :dev_operator_role, [otp_app]}`.
    * `:login_path` — where a non-operator principal is redirected (default `"/login"`).
    * `:path`            — the mount path prefix (default `/operator`).
    * `:labels`          — optional UI copy overrides (operator workspace title/glyph, etc.).
    * `:include_aggregate` — also mount the `aggregate` page on THIS operator mount (default
      `false`). A host that already wires its own token-blind aggregate (a vertical-shaped
      projection via `aggregate_loader:`) mounts it separately and leaves this `false`, so the
      route is not declared twice.
    * `:fleet_cockpit` — mount the WS-J fleet cockpit (ADR-044 §5/§7/§9, T84b) on THIS operator
      mount (default `false`): `/fleet` (tier-1 platform aggregates + the merged T156 cross-
      tenant health surfaces), `/fleet/:app_id` (tier-2 cohort rows), `/fleet/directives` (J4
      flag/announcement publish), `/fleet/register` (J1 register/enroll). Rides the SAME
      `live_session` as every other operator route, so it inherits the T146 `:require_operator`
      `on_mount` gate (RP-J-12) — there is no separate fleet auth hook to forget. A further
      `roles[:fleet]` check (ADR-044 §6.3, the J3 args-carrier) runs INSIDE each fleet LiveView's
      own `mount/3` (role-gated, not session-gated — §5.4's tier-1/2 ladder).
    * `:fleet_namespace` — the `Samen.Fleet.Scope`-mounted Ash domain the cockpit reads
      (`Samen.Fleet.read/2`'s `namespace:` opt) — required when `:fleet_cockpit` is `true` and
      the host's `:fleet` mode is `:manual`/`:heartbeat`; irrelevant (and harmless) for the
      zero-config `:embedded` default (§8.1).
    * `:session_name`    — override the `live_session` name (default `:samen_operator`).

  ## The tier-2 deep-link RESOLVE routes (always mounted, ADR-044 §5.3)

  `GET #{"{path}"}/deliverability/resolve`, `.../automation/resolve`, `.../activity/resolve` —
  the handle→org_id lookup a cockpit's tier-2 deep link lands on — are mounted UNCONDITIONALLY
  (not gated by `:fleet_cockpit`), because ANY product with the drill-in family already mounted
  can be a resolve TARGET regardless of whether it also hosts a cockpit. Handle resolution is
  NOT tier-3 access (§16.4a) — it runs behind the SAME T146 `on_mount` this macro always
  attaches, then redirects to the canonical `:org_id` drill-in, which composes the FULL
  T146+scope+T150 gate exactly as it does for any other arrival (`Samen.Web.Operator.
  Impersonation.gate_socket/3`, wired by T84a).

  is the provider config from ADR-043 §5.2; INV-5):

          ai_crm_resource: Driftwood.Crm.Company,

  The macro mounts `GET /<path>` (verbs) + `/<path>/search` + `/<path>/crm` +
  `/<path>/analytics` + `/<path>/support` under one `live_session`.

  ## Keyless / fail-honest is signposted by construction

  Every surface routes provider-bound bytes through `Samen.AI.Chokepoint` (INV-7 — the
  anti-bypass probe scans `samen_web/lib`), signposts SIMULATED vs live from the T152
  `%Completion{}.simulated` flag, and renders `Samen.AI.configuration_hint/0` verbatim on an
  unconfigured plane — never a fabricated confident answer.

  ## Grounding-resource labels (the `flags_namespace` precedent)

    * `:ai_crm_resource` — the CRM object the CRM-AI surface grounds on (masked, org-scoped);
      unset renders an honest empty state.
    * `:ai_aggregate_resource` — the `use Samen.Aggregate.Resource` projection the analytics
      ask-box queries (operator/platform-gated; a tenant plane is honestly refused).

  ## Options

    * `:repo`   — REQUIRED. The host's Ecto repo.
    * `:domain` — the host Ash domain (default: `namespace`).
    * `:plane`  — `:tenant` (default) or `:operator` (with `:operator_id`/`:target_org_id`).
      The analytics surface only returns real answers on an operator/platform plane.
    * `:path`   — the mount path prefix (default `/ai`); also carried as the `:ai_path` label
      so the in-page tab links resolve.
    * `:labels` — UI copy + the grounding-resource labels above.

  UI half; T118) — `/automation`, list + author/edit workflows over a host's
  materialized Automation scope (`use Samen.Scopes.Automation`, T39) — in ONE line.

  `namespace` is the host's mounted AUTOMATION namespace (the domain that `use`d

  `Run`, unused by this surface), e.g. `Driftwood.Automation`).

  ## TENANT PLANE ONLY (INV-2 — no `:plane` option)

  Unlike its sibling macros, this one does NOT accept a `:plane`/`:operator_id`/
  `:target_org_id` option — the mount is ALWAYS `Samen.Web.Plane.tenant()`. Automation
  is a tenant-AUTHORED surface (T39's done-criterion 4: "builder renders on tenant
  plane only"); the operator-plane counterpart is the SEPARATE, already-shipped
  `Samen.Web.Operator.AutomationHealthLive` (T42, cross-org run log + kill-switch,
  mounted via `samen_operator_routes/2`). There is structurally no code path to mount
  this builder on the operator plane.

  Every mutating affordance (create/edit a workflow, pause/resume, manual "Run now")
  runs through the SAME governed `Workflow` actions T39 shipped: the write-time
  `Samen.Automation.NonPiiPredicates` oracle refuses a vault/plaintext-PII condition
  key or action interpolation (INV-1) and the condition-key picker is sourced LIVE
  from `NonPiiPredicates.eligible_names/1` — never a hardcoded/second field list.
  Pause/resume writes the tenant `status` switch (`:draft | :active | :paused`, the
  SAME kill-switch column family T39/T42 read); it does NOT touch the operator-only
  `disabled_by_operator_at`/`disabled_reason` columns (T42's cross-org emergency stop).

  ADR-042 Class B: the workflow list renders real server HTML with JS off; authoring
  (save/pause/run-now) are `phx-click`/`phx-submit` writes that may need the socket.

    * `GET /auth/oidc/:provider/callback` → `Samen.Web.Auth.OidcController.callback/2`

  An ABSENT/empty `oidc:` emits NEITHER route (the module-absent contract). IdP
  credentials come from app config (`config :samen_web, Samen.Web.Auth.Oidc,
  providers: %{google: [client_id: ..., client_secret: ..., signup: true]}`); an
  unconfigured provider fail-honests `{:error, :not_configured}` (never a dead
  button). `oidc_config:` is an optional compile-time literal override (tests) and
  `oidc_path:` overrides the `/auth/oidc` prefix.

  **Pre-actor public** (ADR-035 §6): no `plane:`/`operator_id:` options — none
  of these surfaces render org data. `:namespace` is the host's Identity
  mount (the SAME namespace `use Samen.Scopes.Identity, namespace: ...`
  materialized `Org`/`Credential`/`User`/`Membership`/`AuthToken`/`Session`/
  `Invitation` into); `:repo` is required. `:signup_path`/`:verify_path`/
  `:reset_path`/`:login_path`/`:logout_path`/`:invite_path`/`:totp_path`
  override the defaults (`/signup`, `/verify`, `/reset`, `/login`, `/logout`,
  `/invite`, `/2fa`) independently; `:path` (legacy, T02) is still honored as
  the signup path override alone. `:labels` — OPTIONAL host label overrides merged onto
  this mount (PP-7, Batch 3 NAV-REACHABILITY) — e.g. `tenant_landing:` (see
  `Samen.Web.Auth.SessionController`'s `finish_login/5` moduledoc). The framework's own
  path labels above always win on a name collision.

  `action-proposals` tool surface for external agents — over an HTTP + SSE endpoint, in ONE
  line (INV-5). A bare `forward` (no `pipe_through`), so it carries NO browser session/CSRF:
  auth is the per-operator bearer token the `:actor_resolver` seam resolves (§9).

      import Samen.Web.Router

      samen_mcp_route(
        actor_resolver: {MyWeb.Api.KeyAuthPlug, :resolve_scope, []},

  Every tool response is EG4 egress masked by the chokepoint `:mcp` scrub in `Samen.AI.Mcp`
  (masked vault fields, no `vt_*` tokens, org-scoped); grants never unlock `:mcp`; and
  action-proposals never execute — they open a T34 approval for a human.

  ## `:actor_resolver` is MANDATORY — safe-by-construction (T142)

  There is **no insecure default**: `samen_mcp_route/1` REFUSES TO COMPILE (raises
  `ArgumentError` at macro expansion) unless `:actor_resolver` is wired. This is deliberate —
  the resolver IS the bearer-credential check, so an adopter can never accidentally ship a
  mount that authenticates nobody. (Even were the raise bypassed, the plug's
  `resolve_actor(nil, _)` still 401s every request — fail-closed at both layers.)

  A vertical adopter's resolver MUST be **constant-time and org-scoped**: compare the
  presented bearer token against the STORED per-operator token DIGEST via
  `Plug.Crypto.secure_compare/2` over SHA-256 (never `==` on the raw token — a byte-by-byte
  `==` is a timing oracle), and return a `%Samen.Scope{}` whose `org_id`/plane come from THAT
  token's owner so `Samen.AI.Mcp`'s hard org filter isolates tenants. The demo/driftwood
  `KeyAuthPlug.digest` lookup is the reference shape. Every adopter that mounts this MUST ship
  an end-to-end auth test over the live HTTP path: unauth ⇒ 401, forged ⇒ 401, and an
  org-A token cannot reach org-B data (ADR-043 §9; the T142 vertical-adoption contract).

  ## Options

    * `:actor_resolver` — **REQUIRED** (compile-time enforced). A `{module, function, args}`
      MFA (or 1-arity fun) taking the RAW bearer token and returning `{:ok, scope}` or
      anything else (⇒ 401). See the constant-time requirement above.
    * `:tool_opts` — the host wiring threaded to `Samen.AI.Mcp.handle_rpc/3`
