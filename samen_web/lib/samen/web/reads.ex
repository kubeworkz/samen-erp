  The shared BOUNDED-reads convention for `samen_web` list pages (ADR-016 §3,
  WS-A design §1.1) — a keyset-pagination query builder every `Reads` module funnels
  its list queries through.

  ## Keyset, not offset

  `build/3` applies `sort → cursor-filter → limit(page_size + 1)`:

    * **sort** — the single UI sort `{field, dir}` with `id` as a same-direction
      tiebreaker, so the total order is strict and a cursor names a unique position.
    * **cursor-filter** — `(field, id) > (cursor_value, cursor_id)` (direction-aware),
      so the page after the cursor is STABLE UNDER CONCURRENT INSERTS: a row inserted
      before the cursor can never shift rows onto the next page (the offset failure
      mode) and no row is skipped or duplicated.
    * **limit** — ALWAYS present; `page_size + 1` probes for `has_more` without a
      count query. Page size is clamped to `max_page_size/0` (a hostile/buggy
      `page_size` is capped, never honored).

  ## Masking / PII posture

  This module builds QUERIES and slices RESULT LISTS. It never renders, stringifies,
  or inspects a field value, never calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, and never unwraps a
  `%Samen.Masked{}`. Cursor values are raw stored terms (for a vaulted attribute that
  is the opaque vault token, never plaintext) that live ONLY in server-side assigns —
  they are never serialized to the client (see `Samen.Web.ListState`). Sort/filter
  fields should be bounded, non-vaulted attributes; filtering a vaulted column would
  match ciphertext tokens, not plaintext — useless, but never a leak.

  The `read!`-elimination LINT (RP-G1-5, WS-A design §1.1, pinned A2 gate carry A2-N1):
  assert that a `ListLive` reads function is BOUNDED — that no matter how large the
  underlying dataset, one call returns at most a clamped page of items and a `%Page{}`
  whose `page_size` is honored.

  ## Why a runtime probe, not a static AST scan

  The design's chosen mechanism is that the mixin's reads fn "routes through
  `Samen.Web.Reads.page!/3` (or an equivalent limit-verified path)". A static "did you
  literally call `page!`" scan is brittle (it green-lights `page!(q, %{state | page_size:
  10_000})` and red-lights an equivalent hand-rolled `limit`). Instead this lint
  EXERCISES the read against a dataset that EXCEEDS the requested page size and proves
  the OBSERVABLE bound: the fn cannot return the full set. An unbounded reads fn (a raw
  `Ash.read!` with no `limit`, or one that stuffs every row into `page.items`) fails
  LOUDLY here — it does not silently return the full set.

  ## Contract asserted

  Given `reads :: (mount, scope, %ListState{}) -> %Page{}`, for a probe page size `p`
  over a dataset of `> p` rows:

    * the result is a `%Page{}` (not a bare list — the bounded carrier), AND
    * `length(page.items) <= bounded_page_size(p)` (the limit held — the full set was
      NOT returned), AND
    * `page.page_size == bounded_page_size(p)` (the page reports its own honored bound,
      so a hostile `page_size` is clamped, never honored).

  Returns `:ok` on a bounded read; RAISES `Samen.Web.Reads.UnboundedReadError` on a
  read that leaks the full set (the RP-G1-5 red path — the test asserts the raise).

    * `:page_size` — the probe page size (default `10`; must be < the dataset size the

  The GENERIC group-by read primitive (G4, WS-G) — group a resource's rows by
  `group_field` into an ORDERED, PER-GROUP-BOUNDED `%Samen.Web.Board{}` (group key → its
  bounded rows). The framework-level building block every WS-G grouped view consumes
  (kanban = columns, calendar = days, gallery = sections, tree = nodes) at ≈0 authored LOC;
  it holds NO vertical-specific logic. First client: the G1 CRM kanban (T51), which groups
  Pipeline opportunities by stage.

  `query` is an `Ash.Query` or resource module — ALREADY resolved through the host mount
  (`Samen.Web.Mount.resource/2`) and any base filter; grouping composes onto it.

  ## Org-scope is UNCONDITIONAL (no opt disables it)

  Every read — rows, discovery, AND the per-group count aggregate — runs through
  `Ash.read!`/`Ash.count!` with the caller's `:scope` AND with authorization ALWAYS ON, so
  `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` narrows EVERY column to the actor's org: a cross-org row (or a
  cross-org count cardinality) can NEVER appear in a group. There is deliberately NO
  `authorize?` opt on this primitive. The CRM resources isolate by the `OrgScope` POLICY
  only (no attribute multitenancy), so `authorize?: false` would be `OrgScope` OFF — a
  boards/kanban has no legitimate system-read case (unlike `page!/3`'s `OrgIsSelf`-style
  account-`Org` reads), so the escape hatch is simply not offered here. The boundary is thus
  not disableable by any caller opt — governed by construction (see
  `reads_group_by_test.exs` "no opt disables org-scoping").

  ## Masking (INV-1)

  REFUSES a vault-routed (🔒) `group_field` with `Samen.Web.Reads.MaskedGroupKeyError` —
  grouping by a secret would leak plaintext or bucket by opaque tokens. Group keys and counts
  are therefore always a non-secret facet. The RETURNED `rows` are raw records the caller
  PII-resolves on its plane (`Samen.Api.PiiResolution`), exactly like a `%Page{}`'s items;
  the board never plaintext-downgrades.

  ## Bounding strategy (no unbounded board)

  Per COLUMN, not one global window: each group is read with its OWN `limit(cap + 1)` probe
  (`filter(group_field == key)`), so a hot column returns at most `cap` rows plus `has_more`
  and an exact DB `count` (aggregate — no row transfer), never the whole column. The number
  of columns is bounded too (`:max_groups`, applied to discovery). Worst-case rows
  transferred ≤ `length(groups) * (cap + 1)` — a 10k-row pipeline can never OOM the LiveView.
  Each group also carries a keyset `next_cursor` (via `cursor_for/2`) so a column is
  paginatable ("load more") later.

  `opts`:

    * `:scope` (REQUIRED) — the org scope; every read/count resolves through it (OrgScope).
    * `:groups` — an ORDERED list of columns as `{key, label}` (or bare `key`) — the kanban
      case where columns are the known Pipeline stages in `stage_order`. When omitted, the

  The GENERIC aggregate-breakdown primitive (G8, T56) — group a resource by a NON-VAULTED
  `group_field` and compute a SQL MEASURE (count / sum / avg) per slice into a bounded
  `%Samen.Web.Series{}` (dimension key → its aggregate number). The framework building block a
  bar/pie chart tile (`Samen.UI.bar_chart/1`, `pie_chart/1`) consumes at ≈0 authored LOC; it
  holds NO vertical logic. First client: the CRM dashboard (`Samen.Web.CRM.DashboardLive`) —
  pipeline value by stage, opportunities by status.

  `query` is an `Ash.Query` or resource module — ALREADY resolved through the host mount
  (`Samen.Web.Mount.resource/2`) and any base filter; the aggregation composes onto it.

  ## Org-scope is UNCONDITIONAL (no opt disables it)

  Every read — slice discovery, EVERY per-slice measure, AND the grand total — runs through
  `Ash.count!`/`Ash.sum!`/`Ash.avg!` with the caller's `:scope` AND authorization ALWAYS ON,
  so `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` narrows EVERY slice to the actor's org: a cross-org row can NEVER
  contribute to a slice measure or to the total. There is deliberately NO `authorize?` opt
  (the T50 boundary; an `:authorize?` key in `opts` is IGNORED, never forwarded) — the
  boundary is not disableable by any caller (see `reads_aggregate_test.exs`).

  ## Computed IN SQL, never load-then-sum (the DB-aggregate keystone)

  Each slice's `value` is a DB aggregate over the org-scoped, group-filtered set — the rows are
  NEVER transferred and summed in Elixir (that would OOM and defeat the point). The returned
  `%Series{}` carries only numbers (no `rows` field exists), so a 10k-row table yields at most
  `max_points` + 1 Points, each a single measure.

  ## Bounded slice set (no unbounded breakdown)

  The number of slices is bounded to `:max_points` (clamped to `max_agg_points/0`): DISCOVERED
  keys past the cap collapse into ONE `Other` slice (`@other_key`), computed as the grand total
  minus the shown slices (arithmetic on SQL aggregates — still no rows), so the breakdown is
  bounded even over an unbounded-cardinality dimension. When `:groups` is given (the caller
  enumerated a bounded domain, e.g. a status enum), those slices are used verbatim.

  ## Masking / aggregate-leak (INV-1, the subtle hazard)

  The PII guarantee here is UNCONDITIONAL: REFUSES a vault-routed (🔒) `group_field` with
  `MaskedGroupKeyError` (a chart label/axis must be a non-secret facet) AND a vault-routed
  SUM/AVG measure field with `MaskedMeasureError` (a summed/averaged secret leaks plaintext or a
  1-cohort value). That refusal — not any option — is what keeps a secret off a chart.

  `:collapse_below` (default `1`, count measures only) is a LABEL-TIDINESS knob, NOT a
  disclosure/anonymity control: a slice whose cohort count is below it is folded into `Other` so
  a long tail of tiny slices does not clutter the chart. It is EXPLICITLY NOT k-anonymity — the
  `Other` VALUE is the arithmetic remainder (`total − shown`, see `other_slice_value/5`), so a
  LONE collapsed cohort's value is fully reconstructable by subtraction (a single hidden slice ⇒
  `Other` == that slice's value). Do NOT rely on it to hide a sensitive dimension's values; the
  only disclosure protection on this path is the vault dimension/measure refusal above.

  `opts`:

    * `:scope` (REQUIRED) — the org scope; every measure resolves through it (OrgScope).
    * `:measure` — `:count` (default), `{:sum, field}`, or `{:avg, field}` (the SQL aggregate).
    * `:groups` — an ORDERED `[{key, label}]` (or bare `key`) list of slices (the bounded-domain
      case, e.g. a status enum); when omitted the distinct keys are DISCOVERED (bounded).
    * `:max_points` — cap on slices (default `#{@default_agg_points}`; clamped to `max_agg_points/0`).
    * `:collapse_below` — a LABEL-tidiness threshold for COUNT measures (default `1` = keep all
      slices); a slice with a smaller count is folded into `Other`. NOT an anonymity control —
      the `Other` value is the arithmetic remainder, so a lone collapsed cohort is recoverable.
    * `:other_label` — the label for the bounded tail slice (default `"Other"`).

      (🔒) coordinate field (`Samen.Web.Reads.MaskedCoordinateError`) — a precise location is PII
      and must not be plotted from the vault (the coordinate-leak guard). A fun is host-computed
      (the host owns any coarsening/blurring; documented, same trust model as a chart `:format`).
    * `:label` — OPTIONAL. A field atom or a 1-arg fun for the marker popover/tooltip text. A
      vaulted label is masked per plane via `:resolve` (below): the renderer draws it verbatim.
    * `:resolve` — OPTIONAL 1-arg fun `([record] -> [record])` run on the bounded rows BEFORE
      marker projection — the seam a caller uses to run `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` on
      the actor's plane, so a vaulted `:label` becomes `%Samen.Masked{}` (→ `••••`) for an
      operator-without-grant, plaintext for the tenant. Defaults to identity (non-PII labels).

  The GENERIC hierarchical read primitive (G6, WS-G) — walk a resource's self-referential
  `parent_field` (a `belongs_to :parent` pointer, e.g. Work `Task`'s `:parent_id`) into a
  DEPTH-BOUNDED, CYCLE-SAFE, per-parent-BOUNDED `%Samen.Web.Tree{}`. The framework-level
  building block a tree view (`Samen.UI.tree/1`) consumes at ≈0 authored LOC; it holds NO
  vertical-specific logic. First client: the Work Task tree (`Samen.Web.Work.TaskTreeLive`).

  `query` is an `Ash.Query` or resource module — ALREADY resolved through the host mount
  (`Samen.Web.Mount.resource/2`) and any base filter; the hierarchy walk composes onto it.

  ## Org-scope is UNCONDITIONAL, AT EVERY LEVEL (no opt disables it)

  EVERY level's children read (roots AND every descendant fetch AND every per-node count) runs
  through `Ash.read!`/`Ash.count!` with the caller's `:scope` AND authorization ALWAYS ON, so
  `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` narrows EVERY level to the actor's org: a cross-org node can NEVER
  appear as a child anywhere in the tree, and no per-node count can leak cross-org cardinality.
  There is deliberately NO `authorize?` opt on this primitive (the T50 boundary; an `:authorize?`
  key in `opts` is IGNORED, never forwarded) — the boundary is not disableable by any caller
  (see `reads_tree_test.exs` "ORG-SCOPE AT EVERY LEVEL").

  ## Cycle safety + depth bound (the hierarchy hazards)

  The CycleGuard prevents a cycle on WRITE, but this READ never TRUSTS the data: a `visited` id
  set is threaded through the walk, so a node whose id was already expanded higher on the path is
  a `truncated: :cycle` leaf and is NOT descended into — the walk ALWAYS terminates (a self-parent
  or an A↔B cycle can never stack-overflow / infinite-loop, proven in `reads_tree_test.exs`). The
  descent is also hard-capped at `max_depth` levels, and the whole walk at a `max_nodes` budget.

  ## Masking (INV-1)

  REFUSES a vault-routed (🔒) `parent_field` with `Samen.Web.Reads.MaskedGroupKeyError` — a
  hierarchy driven by a secret would leak plaintext or nest by opaque tokens. The parent key is
  therefore always a non-secret facet. The returned node `record`s are raw rows the caller
  PII-resolves on its plane (`Samen.Api.PiiResolution`), exactly like a `%Page{}`'s items; the
  tree never plaintext-downgrades.

  ## N+1 strategy (bounded fan-out, NOT unbounded)

  One bounded, org-scoped `limit(sibling_limit + 1)` read per EXPANDED node (roots + each
  descended node) — so at most `max_nodes` bounded queries total, a HARD-BOUNDED fan-out, never
  an unbounded per-node N+1 that could DoS the DB. (A single batched `WHERE parent_id IN (...)`
  per level cannot express a PER-PARENT `LIMIT` in portable SQL; the per-node bounded read buys
  an exact, honest per-parent "+N more" at the cost of ≤ `max_nodes` bounded queries.) Lazy
  drill-in is preferred over eager depth — a `truncated: :depth`/`:budget` node exposes a
  drill-in link that RE-ROOTS the walk at that node (`:root`), so the whole forest is never
  materialized at once.

  `opts`:

    * `:scope` (REQUIRED) — the org scope; every level's read/count resolves through it (OrgScope).
    * `:root` — the node id to walk BELOW (the drill-in focus). `nil` (default) walks the TRUE
      roots (rows whose `parent_field` is `NULL`). The focus id is pre-seeded into `visited`, so
      focusing INTO a cycle terminates immediately.
    * `:sibling_limit` — per-parent (per-level) children cap (default `#{@default_tree_sibling_limit}`;
      clamped to `max_tree_sibling_limit/0`).
    * `:max_depth` — max levels below the roots (default `#{@default_tree_max_depth}`; clamped).
    * `:max_nodes` — total materialized-node budget (default `#{@default_tree_max_nodes}`; clamped).
    * `:row_sort` — `{field, dir}` order WITHIN each level (default `{:id, :asc}`; `id` tiebreaker).
    * `:child_count?` — compute the exact per-node `child_count` (default `true`); `false` skips it.

  @doc """
  The GENERIC calendar read primitive (G2, WS-G) — a TIME-WINDOWED grouped read that buckets
  a resource's rows by the DAY of a `:date` field into an ORDERED, per-DAY-BOUNDED
  `%Samen.Web.Board{}` (one `%Board.Group{}` per calendar day, its `key` a `Date`). The
  framework building block a calendar view renders (columns = days); it holds NO
  vertical-specific logic. First client: the G2 CRM opportunity calendar (T52), which windows
  Opportunities by `:close_date`.

  This is `group_by!/3` SPECIALIZED to a bounded date window, not a reinvention: it computes
  the window's ordered day columns and DELEGATES all grouping, per-column bounding, exact
  counts, org-scoping, AND the vault-field refusal to `group_by!/3`. Everything the calendar
  needs is inherited:

    * **Org-scope is UNCONDITIONAL** — `group_by!/3` reads every day column (rows, discovery,
      count) with authorization ALWAYS ON; there is no `authorize?` opt here either, so a
      cross-org row can never land in a cell (the T50 boundary, honored by construction).
    * **Masking (INV-1)** — `group_by!/3` RAISES `Samen.Web.Reads.MaskedGroupKeyError` if the
      date field is vault-routed (🔒): positioning rows by a secret would leak plaintext or
      bucket by opaque tokens. A calendar's date facet must be a non-secret field.
    * **Per-cell bounding** — each day is read with its own `limit(cap + 1)` probe, so a day
      with hundreds of events returns at most `cap` rows plus `has_more` and an exact DB
      `count` (the "+N more"), never the whole day.

  ## Window bounding (no unbounded scan)

  The number of day columns is bounded TWICE: the window is a bounded date span (`:month` →
  one calendar month; or an explicit `:range`), and a span WIDER than `max_calendar_days/0`
  is REFUSED with `Samen.Web.Reads.UnboundedCalendarRangeError` — a calendar can never fan out
  into a multi-year per-day query storm. The base query is also filtered to the window
  (`date_field >= range_start and date_field < range_end`), so the read is windowed at the
  SQL level, not just partitioned by the day list.

  `date_field` must be a `:date` attribute — day columns key on the exact stored `Date`. A
  non-date field is REFUSED (`ArgumentError`): grouping a `:utc_datetime` by exact value would
  bucket per-timestamp, not per-day (day-truncation is a deliberate future extension, not a
  silent wrong answer).

  `opts`:

    * `:scope` (REQUIRED) — the org scope; every read/count resolves through it (OrgScope).
    * `:month` — any `Date` in the month to render; the window is that whole calendar month
      `[first_of_month, first_of_next_month)`. Mutually exclusive with `:range`.
    * `:range` — an explicit `{range_start, range_end}` (both `Date`, `range_end` EXCLUSIVE).
    * `:per_group_limit` — per-DAY row cap (default `#{@default_calendar_cap}`; clamped to
      `max_group_cap/0` by `group_by!/3`).
    * `:row_sort` — `{field, dir}` order WITHIN a day (default `{:id, :asc}`).
    * `:count?` — compute the exact per-day `count` (default `true`).

  Returns a `%Samen.Web.Board{}` whose `groups` are the window's days IN ORDER (each `key` a
  `Date`, `label` the ISO day string). A day with no rows is still present as an empty column,
  so the calendar grid always has a cell to render. There is NO `authorize?` opt — org-scope
  is unconditional (inherited from `group_by!/3`).

  The GENERIC timeline/Gantt read primitive (G3, WS-G) — a TIME-WINDOWED read that positions a
  resource's rows as horizontal BARS along a time axis by a `start_field`..`end_field` RANGE
  (start + optional end/duration), grouped into an ORDERED, per-lane-BOUNDED `%Samen.Web.Board{}`
  (one `%Board.Group{}` per LANE, or a single lane when no `:lane_field` is given). The framework
  building block a Gantt view renders (`Samen.UI.gantt/1`); it holds NO vertical-specific logic.
  First client: the Work Tasks timeline (T53), which positions Tasks by `:inserted_at`..`:due_at`.

  Where `calendar_by_day!/3` buckets a resource by a single date INTO day columns, a timeline
  spans a RANGE per record, so the window predicate is an OVERLAP test, not a point-in-day test.

  ## Windowed overlap filter (DB-bounded, NOT load-then-filter)

  A record overlaps `[range_start, range_end)` iff `start < range_end AND end >= range_start`.
  This overlap predicate is pushed into SQL (an `Ash.Query.do_filter` on the base query), so the
  read only ever touches rows inside the window — never load-then-filter. A record whose
  `end_field` is NULL/absent is treated as a POINT at its start (`end := start`) — it is included
  when `start` itself falls in the window, and never renders an infinite bar (documented, tested).
  With no `:end_field` at all, every record is a point (`start >= range_start AND start < range_end`).

  ## Org-scope is UNCONDITIONAL (no opt disables it)

  Every read/count runs with the caller's `:scope` and authorization ALWAYS ON (`OrgScope`), so a
  cross-org row can never land in a lane. The lane path DELEGATES to `group_by!/3` (the T50
  boundary, inherited by construction); the single-lane path reads with the same `[scope: scope]`
  and no `authorize?` opt. There is deliberately NO `authorize?` opt on this primitive.

  REFUSES a vault-routed (🔒) `start_field`/`end_field` with `Samen.Web.Reads.MaskedGroupKeyError`
  — POSITIONING a bar by a secret timestamp would leak plaintext (if resolved) or place it by an
  opaque token (if not). A timeline's temporal facet must be a non-secret field (the T50-style
  refusal, applied to the axis fields; `group_by!/3` separately refuses a vaulted `:lane_field`).
  The RETURNED `rows` are raw records the caller PII-resolves on its plane (like a `%Board{}`).

  ## Bounding (no unbounded timeline)

  Per LANE, not one global window: each lane is read with its OWN `limit(cap + 1)` probe, so a hot
  lane returns at most `cap` rows plus `has_more` and an exact DB `count` (the "+N more"), never
  the whole lane. The number of lanes is bounded too (`:max_groups` on discovery, or the explicit
  `:groups`). The WINDOW span is bounded: an inverted/empty range, or a span wider than
  `max_timeline_days/0`, is REFUSED with `Samen.Web.Reads.UnboundedTimelineRangeError`.

  `start_field` (and `end_field`, when given) must be a temporal attribute (a `:date` or
  `:utc_datetime`-family type); a non-temporal field is REFUSED (`ArgumentError`) — you cannot
  position a bar by a string/enum.

  `opts`:

    * `:scope` (REQUIRED) — the org scope; every read/count resolves through it (OrgScope).
    * `:range` (REQUIRED) — `{range_start, range_end}` (`range_end` EXCLUSIVE); both `Date` OR
      both a `DateTime`, matching the field type.
    * `:end_field` — the bar END attribute (nil = point events at `start_field`).
    * `:lane_field` — group rows into lanes by this non-vaulted attribute (nil = a single lane).
    * `:groups` — an ORDERED `[{key, label}]` list of lanes (forwarded to `group_by!/3`; the known
      status/owner lanes). When omitted with a `:lane_field`, lanes are DISCOVERED (bounded).
    * `:per_group_limit` — per-lane row/bar cap (default `#{@default_timeline_cap}`).
    * `:max_groups` — cap on DISCOVERED lanes (default `#{@default_max_groups}`).
    * `:row_sort` — order WITHIN a lane (default `{start_field, :asc}` — bars left-to-right).
    * `:count?` — compute the exact per-lane `count` (default `true`).

  Returns a `%Samen.Web.Board{}` whose `groups` are the lanes (each row a bar). There is NO
  `authorize?` opt — org-scope is unconditional.
