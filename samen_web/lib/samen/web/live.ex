  Shared plumbing for the framework LiveViews: reading the `Samen.Web.Mount` out of the
  `live_session` session and assigning it (ADR-009 §3.5).

  The router macro (`Samen.Web.Router.samen_module_routes/3`) threads the mount through
  `live_session session: %{"samen_mount" => Samen.Web.Mount.to_session(mount)}`, so it is
  present on BOTH the initial dead render and the websocket reconnect. Every framework
  LiveView calls `assign_mount/2` first thing in `mount/3` to rebuild the struct once.

  test that mounts without the router) is tolerated by leaving `:samen_mount` unset — but
  the framework routes always populate it.

  (disconnected dead render, or a host that did not opt into `:peer_data`), it returns
