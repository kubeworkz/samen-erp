defmodule Samen.Web.Operator.HealthScore do
  @moduledoc """
  The composite, EXPLAINABLE per-tenant health score (WS-B / B4, design §2; ADR-019).
  A pure compute layer over the ALREADY-assembled operator account row — no read, no
  clock, no vault, no config write. `score/1` takes the `Samen.Web.Operator.Reads`
  account row and returns a `%HealthBreakdown{score: 0..100, band, factors}` where
  every `%Factor{}` carries its raw `value`, `weight`, `contribution`, and a human
  `explanation` — explainable BY CONSTRUCTION (AC-G17-3): the drill-down renders
  "why this score" without a second computation.

  ## Forward pointer (T77 fix round 1) — a SECOND, narrower per-tenant formula exists;
  they are deliberately NOT unified

  `Samen.Web.AccountHealth` (spec §I4) is a second, DELIBERATELY narrower per-tenant
  health composite — billing + support only, no activity/adoption factors — because it
  must compute honestly on ANY tenant-plane mount, including hosts with no Identity
  mount at all (this module's `:adoption` factor needs Identity `Membership` seats;
  `AccountHealth` cannot assume that exists). The two are NOT meant to converge into
  one formula: this module scores the OPERATOR's book of tenants it directly bills;
  `AccountHealth` scores a TENANT's own book of its own customers (a different
  population entirely — see that module's moduledoc for the full "what account means"
  correction). Anyone adding a THIRD per-tenant/per-org health formula (e.g. for
  `docs/adr/ADR-044-fleet-cockpit.md`'s J2 cockpit aggregates) should read both first
  and reconcile with one of them rather than inventing a fourth.

  ## The four factors (weights are config-defaulted, heuristic per ADR-019 §4)

    * **`:billing`** (40) — subscription state + DUNNING. This is the incoherence fix
      (AC-G17-2): the old pill mapped `status == :active` → healthy while Billing
      showed past-due invoices. Here any past-due invoice (or a `:past_due` /
      `:unpaid` status — the latter is dunning-exhausted, folded in per B4-P2-2)
      puts the account IN DUNNING and structurally CAPS the billing value at
      #{inspect(0.5)} (`@dunning_cap`) — below the factor's top band — scaled down
      further by days-overdue and invoice count. An account in dunning can NEVER
      rate a top billing dimension, and the composite band is capped at `:watch`.
    * **`:activity`** (25) — product-activity recency (G12 `pae`). Until G12 emits,
      the input is absent and the factor is `:unknown`: it contributes 0 and the
      remaining weights RENORMALIZE, so the score still computes (AC-G17-7) and
      gains fidelity when G12 lands. No fake number is invented.
    * **`:support`** (20) — open-ticket + SLA-breach load (inverse).
    * **`:adoption`** (15) — seat breadth (active admin memberships as the
      minimal-viable seat proxy); flag-adoption breadth folds in when G6 wires.

  ## Score / band arithmetic (the property-tested invariants)

  Each known factor's `contribution = round1(value × weight ÷ known_weight × 100)`
  (weights renormalize over the KNOWN factors); `score = clamp(round(Σ contributions))`.
  So the breakdown always SUMS to the composite (AC-G17-1), the score is always in
  `0..100`, and the compute is deterministic — pure data in, pure data out.

  Bands: `:healthy ≥ 85 · :watch ≥ 65 · :at_risk ≥ 40 · :critical` below — with the
  DUNNING CEILING: if the billing dimension rates at-risk-or-worse, the composite
  band is capped at `:watch`, whatever the other factors say. That is the
  health/dunning coherence guarantee, encoded, not styled.

  ## Not a new PII surface (ADR-019 §3 / AC-G17-5)

  Every input is a bounded count / enum / cent amount / day count. No name, email, or
  freeform string enters the score or the breakdown; the `explanation` strings are
  built from those bounded values only.
