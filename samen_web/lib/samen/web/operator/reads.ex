defmodule Samen.Web.Operator.Reads do
  @moduledoc """
  Operator control-plane read layer (ADR-010 §6). Reads the OPERATOR ORG's own book of
  business on the TENANT plane, so tenant-org accounts and their tenant-admins render PII
  CLEAR — the SaaS owns this data. Assembles "accounts" by joining the Identity/Billing/Support
  scopes over the operator org.

  ## MASKING INVARIANT (inherited from ADR-009)

  Never calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, never unwraps a `%Masked{}`, never has a "show
  plaintext" branch. Tenant-admin PII (`User.full_name`/`emails`, `Customer.billing_name`/
  `billing_email`, `Message.body`) is clear ONLY because the operator-org TENANT-plane resolver
  clears own-org PII — the SAME `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` chokepoint the ADR-009 reads
  use. The DOWNSTREAM tenant's end-customer PII is never read here; that is the impersonation
  path (`Samen.Web.CRM.*` under `plane: :operator`), which this module does NOT touch.

  ## Why the account `Org` read is `authorize?: false` but PII stays governed

  The Identity `Org` anchor's read policy is `Samen.Policy.OrgIsSelf` (`id == actor.org_id`) —
  it authorizes only the reader's OWN org row, by design (an org anchor is org-less). The
  operator's per-tenant ACCOUNT rows are OTHER `Org` rows in the operator namespace, so a scoped
  Org read would return only the operator org itself. `Org` carries NO PII (name/slug/plan
  only — ADR-010 §8.3), so it is read here with an explicit `org_id` filter over the operator
  namespace (trusted framework read of its own book of business); the identity line is drawn on
  the PII-bearing joins (Users/Customers/Messages), which DO go through `OrgScope` +
  `PiiResolution` on the tenant plane. Reading a non-PII grouping row leaks nothing.

  ## A3 read-bounding + sanctioned writes

  The hot lists (Accounts, Desk) read through the paginated `accounts_page/3` /
  `desk_page/3` (Accounts on the T127 cross-tenant `Samen.Web.Reads.page_operator!/3`, Desk on
  the org-scoped `Samen.Web.Reads.page!/3` — both BOUNDED BY CONSTRUCTION); every
  join/lookup read carries an explicit `limit(#{200})`. The write side exposes ONLY
  domain-defined actions: the Org anchor create (account provisioning — always-authorized
  by the identity blueprint's bootstrap policy) and the desk `Ticket` create/destroy
  (member-gated). No account-org destroy is offered — see the write-side section note.

  every past-due determination — the score's dunning evidence AND each invoice's
  rendered `__past_due__` flag derive from the SAME instant, so a due date crossing
  "now" mid-assembly can never desync the flag from the score. The LiveView renders
  `__past_due__` verbatim and NEVER reads a clock.

  Returns `%{account:, movements:, tickets:, invoices:}` or `nil` (unknown account /
  read error) — the LiveView renders "not found", never a crash.

  # ≤7d → 1.0, ≤30d → 0.7, ≤90d → 0.35, else 0.1; absent → `:unknown`, weights
  # renormalize). For each tenant org, the WHOLE-DAYS age of its most-recent `pae`
  # (`Analytics.ProductEvent`, ADR-021) event vs the threaded `now` — a non-negative
