defmodule Samen.Web.Operator.DeliverabilityReads do
  @moduledoc """
  Operator per-tenant deliverability read layer (R2, T114; `_orch/ux/dogfood-report.md`
  R3 — P4 job-test 3, "why didn't this tenant get their email?"). Surfaces the T28/T30
  delivery substrate: `Samen.Delivery.EmailEvent` (`dlv_email_event` — the webhook-
  confirmed delivery/bounce/complaint/open/click history) and `Samen.Delivery.Suppression`
  (`dlv_suppression` — the current suppression fact) for ONE tenant org, cross-tenant
  (an operator drilling into ANY tenant org, not just the operator's own book).

  ## Recipient resolution — the ONLY new masking-relevant code this task adds

  Both `dlv_email_event` and `dlv_suppression` are, BY DESIGN, token-blind: no PII
  column exists on either (ADR-038 §4.4 / the `Suppression` moduledoc). Every
  recipient reference is an opaque `subscriber_id`. Resolving "who" for display
  looks the id up as an `Identity.User` in the SAME org (the identity blueprint
  every host mounts — the only family this framework-level surface can resolve
  generically; a marketing/CRM-family subscriber_id that isn't a User row
  resolves to `nil` and renders by its bounded id, NEVER fabricated) and then runs
  it through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` — the SAME chokepoint every other
  framework read uses. This module holds no masking logic of its own.

  ## The operator actor (mirrors `Samen.Delivery.Rendering.operator_plane_actor/0`)

  This is a CROSS-TENANT lookup (the operator can view ANY tenant org's delivery
  state, not only its own book), so it does not ride `Samen.Web.Operator.scope/1`
  (which is the operator ORG's own tenant-plane scope). Instead it uses the SAME
  "operator previewing tenant PII without a live impersonation session" actor
  shape `Samen.Delivery.Rendering` already ships for operator message previews:
  `plane: :operator` + an impersonation marker — masked-but-PRESENT (`••••`) by
  default, PLAINTEXT the moment a live `Samen.Reveal` grant covers the specific
  subscriber (the SAME T1.6 reveal-grant model every other operator PII read
  honors). No new masking rule is invented here.

  Assemble ONE tenant org's delivery/suppression state. Returns
  `%{events:, suppressions:, suppressed_subscriber_ids:}` — `events`/`suppressions`
  rows carry a `:__recipient__` key (`%{name:, email:}`, each possibly `%Masked{}`,
  or `nil` when the subscriber_id does not resolve to a known `Identity.User`).
  `suppressed_subscriber_ids` is a `MapSet` of every currently-suppressed
  subscriber, so a delivery-timeline row can flag itself "suppressed" without a
  second read. Any read error degrades to the all-empty shape — fail-honest,
