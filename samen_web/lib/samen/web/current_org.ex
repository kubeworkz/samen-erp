defmodule Samen.Web.CurrentOrg do
  @moduledoc """
  The session-resolved CURRENT ORG for tenant-plane + shared LiveViews (ADR-013 §4).

  Before this module, every tenant/shared page read `Map.get(params, "org")` and dead-ended
  (`no_org: true` → "No org selected. Append `?org=<uuid>`") when it was absent — the demo
  required hand-typing a UUID into the URL. This module owns the ONE resolution order every
  such LiveView asks: "what org am I acting on?" — with a sensible dev default and NO dead-end.

  It governs ONLY the tenant + shared planes. The operator/aggregate planes scope to the
  operator org via `Samen.Web.Operator.org_id/1` and do NOT use this resolver.

  ## Resolution order (`resolve/3`, first hit wins)

    1. `params["org"]` — an explicit `?org=<uuid>` deep link / drill-in target / test param.
       Still fully supported; the switcher/drill-in ALSO writes it to the session (via the
       `SessionController`) so subsequent same-plane navigation stays sticky.
    2. `session["samen_current_org"]` — the org last chosen through the switcher or the
       operator "Open account →". This is what makes navigation sticky.
    3. `Mount.label(mount, :default_org_id, nil)` — a host may pin a default tenant org on the
       mount (data on the mount, not code). Driftwood pins Blue Ridge Logistics in dev.
    4. `first_listable_org_id(mount)` — the first org from the mount's directory (§below), so a
       freshly-seeded environment lands on a POPULATED page even with no default set.

  Falls through to `nil` ONLY when nothing resolves (an unseeded DB). The LiveViews render a
  friendly "run `mix driftwood.seed`" seed-state card in that case (`no_org?/1`), never the
  old "type a UUID" instruction.

  ## The tenant directory (`list_orgs/1`) — powers the switcher + the name label

  The switcher and the first-listable default both need "the tenant orgs this seat may act on."
  Framework-side that is the operator org's ACCOUNTS (each account row IS a tenant org). A plain
  tenant/shared mount cannot see the operator namespace, so the host exposes the directory
  through a mount label seam: `Mount.label(mount, :org_directory, {mod, fun, args})` — an MFA the
  host wires that returns `[{org_id, name}, …]`. Absent the seam, `list_orgs/1` returns `[]` and
  the switcher hides (graceful). An operator/aggregate mount that carries `:operator_org_id`
  reads its accounts directly via `Samen.Web.Operator.Reads.accounts/3`.

  ## Masking invariant (unchanged)

  Nothing here reads or writes a mask. Current-org resolution only decides WHICH org's data a
  page reads; `Samen.Api.PiiResolution` still decides clear-vs-`••••` by `actor.plane`. The
  masking line is the plane line (ADR-010 §5), untouched.

  default label or `nil`.

  ## The authenticated prod-path gate (F2 / ADR-031)

  The order above is the DEV/dogfood convenience path: a `?org=<uuid>` is trusted as identity.
  For a real launch that is an authentication hole — anyone could act as any org's member by
  typing its id. When the mount opts into `authn` (a host label; driftwood wires it to a
  runtime `:auth_required?` flag), `resolve/3` switches to the FAIL-CLOSED prod path:

    1. the session MUST carry an authenticated principal (`Samen.Web.Auth.authenticated_user_id/1`,
       set only by a real host login — never a query param); absent it → `nil` (NO actor);
    2. the org is constrained to the principal's authorized set (the host-wired `:authorized_orgs`
       seam — an `{mod, fun, args}` returning `[org_id, …]`); a `?org=`/session org OUTSIDE that
       set never resolves — the viewer lands on their own first authorized org, never the target;
    3. no principal, no seam, or an empty authorized set → `nil` (NO actor).

  The security boundary is this actor-derivation step, not the `SessionController` write: even a
  session carrying an unauthorized org yields no actor for it here.

  ## Fail-closed default on an ARMED host (PP-1 / PP-3, ADR-031)

  The `?org=`/session convenience is a DEV/dogfood affordance and is trusted ONLY in the
  explicitly DISARMED posture (`param_trust_disarmed?/1` — the host's `:auth_required?` runtime
  flag is false/unset, mirroring `Samen.Web.Operator.Impersonation.auth_disarmed?/1`). On an
  ARMED host (`config otp_app, auth_required?: true`) a mount that carries NO `:authn` label no
  longer falls through to the trusting dev path — it FAILS CLOSED (`nil`, no actor, no PII). This
  closes the class where a vertical mounts a PII-bearing tenant scope but never adopts the
  tenant-auth seam (the pawchart cross-tenant leak): such a mount is safe-because-DENIED, not
  safe-because-trusted. A correctly `:authn`-labelled mount (driftwood) keeps working: armed → the
  authorized path above; disarmed (dev/test) → the query-param convenience, unchanged.

  Re-resolve the current org inside `handle_params/3` — the ONE shared helper every framework
  tenant LiveView calls in place of the old `Map.get(params, "org") || socket.assigns.org_id`
  idiom (B-SEC / S1, the confirmed BLOCKER).

  ## Why this exists

  In `phoenix_live_view` 1.2.9 `handle_params/3` runs on the INITIAL DEAD RENDER (plain HTTP
  GET, before any socket). The old idiom therefore OVERWROTE the fail-closed `resolve/3` answer
  computed one callback earlier in `mount/3` with a raw, client-supplied `?org=` — reopening the
  cross-tenant read (and, through the `write_scope/2` admin elevators, a cross-tenant admin
  WRITE) on every armed host. The client param was an IDENTITY; here it is downgraded to a
  SELECTOR, exactly as the operator drill-ins already treat `params["org_id"]`.

  ## The rule (strictly narrower than before; never wider)

    * `:samen_authorized_orgs` pinned by `Samen.Web.TenantAuthz`'s `on_mount` — a `?org=` is
      honoured ONLY when it is a member of the authenticated principal's authorized set;
      anything else keeps the org the gate/`mount/3` already resolved. (This is what keeps the
      workspace switcher and legitimate multi-org deep links working.)
    * `:unconstrained` (the explicitly DISARMED dev/dogfood posture, or an operator-plane mount
      whose authorization is the T146/T150 gate) — the historical `?org=` convenience,
      byte-for-byte unchanged.
    * no pin at all (a LiveView mounted outside the framework tenant macros) — the posture is
      re-derived from the mount: DISARMED keeps the convenience; ARMED refuses the param and
      keeps `mount/3`'s fail-closed answer. So the fix holds even where the hook does not run.

  The WORKSPACE SWITCHER (ADR-013 §5.1). Renders the current org's name + a chevron; clicking
  opens a native `<details>` dropdown listing every tenant org from `list_orgs/1` plus a pinned
  operator-plane entry (return to the operator plane).

  The operator-plane entry's LABEL is derived from the mount (`operator_label/1` — the host's
  `:operator_workspace` label, neutral `"Operator"` default), NEVER a hardcoded vertical name
  (P9-F2): driftwood renders "Driftwood Ops", pawchart/uxwalk/any gen.app render THEIR own
  operator-plane name (or the neutral default) — the shared switcher no longer mislabels every
  non-driftwood host's boundary with the reference vertical's brand.

  Each tenant row is a zero-JS `<form method="post">` submitting to
  `POST /session/org/<org_id>?return_to=<path>` (the framework `SessionController`) with the
  Phoenix `_csrf_token`, which writes the session current org and redirects back to the same
  module for the newly chosen org. POST because the switch is a session WRITE (luminary S7 —
  the old GET was CSRF-forgeable and prefetch-triggerable; a stale GET now redirects without
  switching). Plain disclosure + native forms — works on the dead render, no JS hook, matching
  the ADR-012 "works before the socket connects" posture (LiveView seeds the CSRF state into
  the connected process, so the token is session-valid on both renders). Hidden when the
  directory is empty.

  `compact: true` (the default in the CRM/Billing/Support sidebar header, where the `.who`
  block already prints the org name) renders just the chevron so the name is not duplicated.

  The workspace list the switcher OFFERS as act-as targets, with ADR-044 Amendment-1
  account-level NAME scoping applied (§16.2/§16.4a, the T159 switcher residual).

  On the OPERATOR plane the switcher enumerates cross-tenant ACCOUNTS (each row IS a tenant
  org) — the SAME cross-tenant name+id surface `/operator/accounts` masks. An operator WITHOUT
  the `scope_of/2` right for an account MUST NOT see that account's NAME or `tenant_org_id`
  here, consistent with the accounts list. The mask is BY OMISSION: an out-of-scope entry is
  DROPPED ENTIRELY — no name, no org_id in any `href`/attribute — because a switcher entry is a
  pure identity + act-as affordance with NO non-identifying aggregate to preserve (unlike an
  accounts ROW, which keeps its opaque plan/health/MRR cells). Omitting is the honest analog.

  Same seam as `Samen.Web.Operator.AccountsLive.name_masked?/3`:
  `Samen.Fleet.Resolution.{configured?/1, scope_of/2, in_scope?/2}`. Preserved properties:

    * **no-lockout** — a TENANT/shared switcher, or a product wiring NO `:fleet_resolution`
      seam, keeps EVERY entry (today's behaviour). Scoping engages ONLY on an operator/aggregate
      mount whose product has the seam configured.
    * **fail-closed** — `scope_of/2` collapses to `:none` on any resolver error ⇒ every entry
      is out of scope ⇒ dropped (the switcher then hides), never leaked.

  This is NAME/id VISIBILITY in the list only — layered ON TOP of the T146/T150 act-as gate; it
  never weakens the `/session/org/` act-as authorization the chosen entry still routes through.

  The PLANE-LEGIBILITY BADGE (T116, P9-F3) — the persistent chrome element that makes the
  current plane + org legible on EVERY shared samen_web surface. Rendered once per page at the
  top of the main pane (via `acting_as_banner/1`, which every tenant/shared LiveView already
  calls with `mount`/`org_id`/`acting_as`, so all hosts inherit it at ≈0 authored LOC).

  It answers the two questions a person on any surface must be able to answer from the screen —
  WHICH plane am I on, and WHOSE org am I viewing — in one of three states:

    * **tenant plane** (the default; the previously UNLABELLED plane) — a tenant-glyph badge
      reading the RESOLVED org name + "Tenant plane · in the clear" (`data-plane="tenant"`).
      This is the marker that also makes an operator's silent O→T crossing legible: whatever
      tenant mount they land on (e.g. the operator-nav Notifications mislink, AMB-1/P5-F1) now
      announces "Tenant plane · <org> · in the clear" on arrival.
    * **operator plane** (masked) — an operator SHIELD-glyph badge reading the operator
      workspace name + "Operator plane · masked" (`data-plane="operator"`). Detected by the
      mount's `:operator`/`:aggregate` scope OR an operator `plane.kind`, so it fires on the
      operator's own book of business (ADR-010: operator scope on the tenant PII plane) too.
    * **operator ACTING AS a tenant** (the dangerous O→T crossing, `acting_as: true` on a
      tenant plane) — a strong-styled CROSSING marker (`data-crossing="true"`, the operator
      shield glyph, id `acting-as-bar`): "You are viewing <org> (acting as tenant)" + a
      "Return to <operator>" link UP to the operator plane. This is the human-facing
      counterpart to the T115/T38 impersonation-write audit — the crossing is VISIBLE, not
      silent. Removing this marker is a legibility regression the tests refute.

  GLYPH DISCIPLINE: exactly two glyphs across all planes — a document/org glyph for the tenant
  plane and a SHIELD glyph for operator presence (operator plane + the acting-as crossing) —
  so tenant vs operator chrome is visually distinguishable even where the sidebar glyph LETTER
  collides (uxwalk's pixel-identical blue "S", P9-F1). The badge derives colour from
  `data-plane` (CSS), so the distinction survives even a colour-blind read via the glyph shape.

  Masking: presentational only — it renders the org DISPLAY name (non-secret) + static plane
  copy. It reads no vault-routed field and carries the same masking guarantees as the page it
  wraps (CLAUDE.md plane discipline; `Samen.Api.PiiResolution` untouched).
