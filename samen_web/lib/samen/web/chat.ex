defmodule Samen.Web.Chat do
  @moduledoc """
  The chat CONTEXT (ADR-012 §6.1) — the framework-level entry points a host LiveView calls to
  drive cross-plane realtime chat + object unfurl. Thin composition over the untouched kernel:
  every write goes through Ash (so `OrgScope` + `RoleAtLeast` + `SameOrgFk` + the vault apply);
  every read goes through `Samen.Web.Chat.Reads` (so PII resolves per plane). This context adds
  NO policy and NO masking of its own.

  ## The send flow (masking BY CONSTRUCTION on the realtime path)

  `post_message/4` is the load-bearing seam:

    1. **Parse object refs on the PLAINTEXT** (`Samen.Web.ObjectRef.parse/1`) BEFORE the body
       is vaulted (§4.2), and store them on `ChatMessage.refs` — so unfurl never re-parses
       ciphertext.
    2. **Persist the message via Ash** — the body is vault-routed on write (clear at rest never
       happens); `OrgScope` + `SameOrgFk` apply.
    3. **Broadcast an ID-ONLY envelope** (`Samen.Web.Chat.PubSub.broadcast_message/3`) — the
       message id, never the resolved body. Each subscriber re-reads per its own plane.

  A plaintext body therefore never transits PubSub; the operator subscriber's re-read resolves
  `••••` (red path 3). The unfurl cards mask per plane on the realtime path for free, because
  the refs re-resolve through `Samen.Web.ObjectRef.resolve_string/3` for the receiving viewer.

  Post a message: parse refs → persist (vault + org-scope) → broadcast id-only. `attrs` carries

  never lost to a dead PubSub server.

  ## Mentions (WS-A design §2.3 — the "chat_mention" event source)

  `@handle` mentions are parsed from the PLAINTEXT body at send time (the same
  pre-vault parse as refs, via `ObjectRef.parse_mentions/1`) and matched against the
  thread's participants by their NON-PII handle. Each mentioned participant (never

  `Samen.Notifications.Engine.emit/2` — BEST-EFFORT (a notify failure never fails
  the post) and preference-gated (a recipient whose `NotificationPreference`
  suppresses `"chat_mention"` gets NO record — the red path). The notification
  carries bounded ids + the sender's handle only — never the message body (the body
  is vaulted; copying it into another record would denormalize PII).

  Options: `broadcast: false` skips PubSub (seeds); `notify: opts` forwards engine
  seams (`:notification_module`/`:preference_module`/`:repo`/`:broadcaster`) — a
  test/caller override; absent, the engine's app-config wiring applies.
