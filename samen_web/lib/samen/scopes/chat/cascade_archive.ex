defmodule Samen.Scopes.Chat.CascadeArchive do
  @moduledoc """
  Archive-side half of the chat `thread ▸ participant` / `thread ▸ message` composition
  cascade (ADR-040 §5.4: "chat Thread → Message" is one of the three named cascade pairs;
  the roster's ¶ footnote extends the same same-instant cascade to `participant`
  — "archiving a thread also retires its cross-plane grants from default reads on both
  planes"). Mirrors `Samen.Scopes.Cms.CascadeArchive` (T37b) — same self-guard, same
  after_action/force_change_attribute shape — generalized to TWO cascaded resources
  instead of one.

  Self-guards on `changeset.action.name == :archive`. The resource-level
  `changes do change(...) end` block Thread declares this in applies to every action by
  default (create/update/destroy alike); action TYPE (`:destroy`) alone cannot discriminate
  the explicit `:archive` soft-destroy from the plain `:destroy`, so the guard is on the
  action NAME.

  ## Why NOT ash_archival's `archive_related` DSL option

  Same two gaps `Samen.Scopes.Cms.CascadeArchive` documents in full:

    1. **Timestamp exactness.** `archive_related` cascades via a separate `Ash.bulk_destroy!`
       against each child's own primary destroy action; `Ash.Resource.Change.SetAttribute`
       calls `DateTime.utc_now/0` ONCE PER invocation, so the parent's stamp and the
       cascaded children's stamp are independent clock reads, not guaranteed byte-identical.
       ADR-040 §5.4's restore-side contract ("restore of a cascade parent restores exactly
       the children whose `archived_at` EQUALS the parent's") needs a real equality.
    2. **Audit completeness.** `archive_related` invokes each child's PRIMARY (plain,
       unaudited) destroy action, not the explicit `:archive` action `Samen.Archival.Archive`
       is attached to — cascaded participants/messages would silently skip the
       `record_archived` audit event and the idempotence guard.

  Both `ChatParticipant` and `ChatMessage` are `archivable: true`. `ChatParticipant`'s
  `:archive`/`:restore` actions are policy-locked to `forbid_if(always())` for any real actor
  (the cross-plane grant-carrier exception, §5.9 ¶); `ChatMessage` carries NO such lock as of
  T125 (ADR-040 §5.4/§5.9 reconciled, posture A) — an authorized actor may also archive a
  message directly. Either way, this change routes each cascaded member through its own
  `:archive` action with `authorize?: false` (bypassing policy entirely, same as every other
  cascade in this foundry) so the cascade path itself never depends on — and is never blocked
  by — either resource's actor-facing policy, keeping the audit trail complete regardless.

  Runs inside the parent `:archive` action's transaction (nested `Ash`/`Ecto.Repo.transaction`
  calls in the same process reuse the outer transaction), so a failure here rolls back the
  thread's own archive too.
