defmodule Samen.Scopes.Chat.CascadeRestore do
  @moduledoc """
  Restore-side half of the chat `thread ▸ participant` / `thread ▸ message` composition
  cascade — the counterpart to `Samen.Scopes.Chat.CascadeArchive` (ADR-040 §5.4: "restore of
  a cascade parent restores exactly the children whose `archived_at` equals the parent's —
  the same-instant match; a child independently archived earlier stays archived"). Mirrors
  `Samen.Scopes.Cms.CascadeRestore` (T37b), generalized to TWO cascaded resources.

  Self-guards on `changeset.action.name == :restore` (action TYPE alone, `:update`, cannot
  discriminate `:restore` from the plain `:update`, since the DSL's `on:` option only
  filters by type).

  Reads the thread's PRE-restore `archived_at` (`changeset.data.archived_at` — the exact
  instant `Samen.Scopes.Chat.CascadeArchive` stamped onto both the thread and its cascaded
  participants/messages) and restores exactly the archived Participants/Messages whose own
  `archived_at` equals that instant. A member archived independently (a different instant,
  whether before or after the thread's cascade-archive, or a distinct wall-clock second, or
  the SAME wall-clock second but a different microsecond post-T124) is left alone — restore
  is scoped to the cascade set, not "every archived member under this thread".

  Runs inside the parent `:restore` action's transaction. A `:restore_conflict` on any
  matched member aborts the WHOLE transaction (the parent restore included) —
  `Enum.reduce_while` halts on the first error and returns it, which the enclosing
  `after_action` propagates as a transaction rollback, never a partial cascade.
