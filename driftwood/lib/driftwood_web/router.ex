defmodule DriftwoodWeb.Router do
  @moduledoc """
  The Driftwood host router (T5.3; rewired to the framework per ADR-009).

  The inherited-80% product UI (CRM / Billing / Support + the operator aggregate) is no
  longer driftwood-local: it is MOUNTED from `samen_web`. Driftwood supplies the three
  host facts (namespace + repo) and the framework derives everything else:

    * TENANT plane — the org acts over its OWN data (PII in the clear):
      * `/broker` (`DriftwoodWeb.BrokerLive`) — the freight console (the vertical 20%).
      * CRM / Billing / Support — mounted via `samen_module_routes` over the inherited
        `Driftwood.{Crm,Billing,Support}` scope namespaces (`Samen.Web.{CRM,Billing,Support}`
        LiveViews). PII on contacts / customers / agents / message bodies is plane-resolved
        through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution`: tenant plane in the clear.
    * OPERATOR plane:
      * `/operator/impersonate` (`DriftwoodWeb.OperatorImpersonationLive`) — masked
        impersonation over ONE tenant's freight resources (PII ••••), plus the
        second-party reveal control. Freight-shaped, so it stays driftwood-local.
      * `/operator/aggregate` (`Samen.Web.Operator.AggregateLive`) — the framework
        token-blind cross-tenant dashboard, fed Driftwood's MRR / load-volume projection
        via the `aggregate_loader:` MFA on the mount labels (NO PII by construction).

  `/` is a plain landing/health page (the boot curl check). `/healthz` returns `ok`. The
  org/operator identity is passed as query params for the LOCAL dogfood — a real deploy
  derives them from an authenticated session (see docs/driftwood-dogfood.md).

  # ADR-013 §4.4 — the current-org data-on-the-mount labels shared by every tenant/shared mount:
  #   :default_org_id — the sensible dev default (Blue Ridge Logistics), so a page with no ?org
  #     renders a populated org (resolution step 3), never a dead-end;
  #   :org_directory  — the `{mod,fun,args}` the framework switcher + name resolution read
  #     (`Driftwood.Directory.orgs/0` → `[{tenant_org_id, name}]` over the operator accounts).
  # A module attribute (not a function) so it is a compile-time literal usable inside the
  # `samen_module_routes` macro expansion; both values are session-safe (a uuid + an MFA of atoms).
  # F2 (ADR-031) — the launch AUTH gate seams every tenant/shared mount carries:
  #   :authn          — `{:app_env, :driftwood, :auth_required?}`: OFF in dev/test (the
  #     query-param convenience identity stays), ON in prod (the actor is derived only from
  #     an authenticated session — see docs/launch-checklist.md).
  #   :authorized_orgs — the membership seam `Samen.Web.CurrentOrg` calls to constrain the
  #     tenant actor to the authenticated user's OWN orgs (`{mod, fun, args}`, user_id
  #     appended). Driftwood's reference sources it from `Driftwood.Auth`; a real deploy
  #     points it at `Identity.Membership` rows.
  # T116/P9-F2 — the operator-plane label the SHARED cross-plane chrome (workspace switcher
  # return link, acting-as crossing marker, no-org card) derives instead of the old hardcoded
  # "Driftwood Ops"/"mix driftwood.seed" framework leak. Data on the mount, not code: driftwood
