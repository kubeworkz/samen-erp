defmodule Driftwood.Context do
  @moduledoc """
  Driftwood's bounded context (design §1.2, §3) — the anti-corruption layer that
  writes freight's ubiquitous language over the shared kernel, using `Samen.Context`:

    * `alias_resource Company, as: Carrier` AND `as: Shipper` — two ubiquitous-language
      renames over ONE kernel Company (DECISION C2). The alias is a NAME only; the
      kernel Company's OrgScope/vault/audit ride underneath unchanged. The role is
      carried in the `company_role` Tier-1 custom field; aliased reads filter on it.
    * `alias_resource Opportunity, as: Load` — the freight load/shipment (DECISION L).
    * `alias_resource Work.Task, as: CheckCall` — the routine check-call event stream
      (DECISION A). Post ADR-041 (ruling M5) the CRM `Activity` was destructively
      migrated into the canonical Work-scope `Task` and removed, so CheckCall now
      re-identifies `Driftwood.Work.Task` (the migration destination) — the aliased
      read still runs against the kernel resource, org-scoped, under the anti-corruption
      invariant. Dispatch itself is the vertical DispatchEvent resource.
    * `reshape Settlement do … end` — the carrier-settlement netting math as derived
      `calculate … expr(...)` fields (DECISION S). This is the load-bearing billing
      reshape: `net_payable = linehaul − advances − factoring_fee − claims`, clamped
      at 0 with the shortfall as `carryover` (DECISION N).

  ## OR-4 resolution (inlined net_raw)

  Ash expression calculations do not reliably reference sibling calcs within one
  reshape block, so `net_raw` is INLINED into `net_payable_cents` and
  `carryover_cents`. The arithmetic is byte-for-byte the §3.5 canonical math; the
  property test (`SettlementMathTest`) pins every worked example to the cent,
  including the negative/carryover edge and the integer-division truncation (OR-5).
