defmodule Driftwood.NonPiiSetup do
  @moduledoc """
  Runtime registration of Driftwood's deliberate non-PII columns (design OR-2, §1.5).

  `drv_cdl_state` and `drv_cdl_expiry` are plain columns whose NAMES contain `cdl`,
  which is on `pii_classify`'s likely-PII token list — so the verifier FLAGS them and
  fails the build until they are cleared by a review-gated `non_pii!` with a DISTINCT
  second reviewer (fail-closed on self-review, the same distinct-party discipline as
  reveal grants). A US state code and a CDL EXPIRY DATE are not subject-identifying
  alone (the CDL NUMBER is the PII, and it lives vaulted in `pii_drv_cdl_number`).

  `drv_medical_card_expiry` does not hit the token list but is registered too, for a
  complete, auditor-legible non-PII inventory.

  Called from test setup and the seed task. Idempotent.

  # Each entry: {table, column, redaction, reason}. `redaction` is the value written
  # over the plaintext on a driver-erasure request (design §5: plaintext-at-rest
  # non_pii columns are erased by row-level text redaction on a driver crypto-shred,
  # NOT key-shred. Both registered columns are TEXT-typed so the substrate's
  # text-redaction arm can overwrite the plaintext. `drv_medical_card_expiry` is a
  # :date column with no clearance: under the ADR-015 default-deny flip it is
  # grandfathered by the committed schema.dict.json baseline (it would flag as a
  # NEW column), stays EXCLUDED from the CDC/aggregate projection (the A1 triage's
  # conservative default), and is erased by row deletion with the driver.
