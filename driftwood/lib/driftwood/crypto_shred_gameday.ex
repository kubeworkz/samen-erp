  T5.4 — THE CRYPTO-SHRED GAME-DAY against the LIVE Driftwood app.

  This is the machinery the vision doc says you show an auditor: erase a REAL
  Driftwood driver subject whose PII is spread across EVERY tier, run the destruction
  oracle (`mix samen.verify.no_plaintext_pii --subject <uuid> --tiers all`), and prove
  the driver is unrecoverable while the tamper-evident audit/impersonation chain still
  VERIFIES.

  ## The subject and its PII spread (clause: "spread across EVERY tier")

  `seed_driver_across_tiers/2` seeds ONE real `Driftwood.Freight.Driver` and spreads
  its PII across every key-reachable + carve-out tier:

    * **domain rows** — `drv_driver`: full_name/emails/phones (CorePerson composite
      vaults) + `pii_drv_cdl_number` (the scalar CDL vault). The physical columns hold
      only `vt_` tokens; the plaintext is in `pii_vault`.
    * **vault** — `pii_vault` rows for `pii_name` / `pii_email` / `pii_phone` /
      `pii_cdl`, all ciphertext under the driver's per-subject DEK.
    * **aud_event** — dispatch-class + reveal-lifecycle + erasure rows keyed on the
      driver `subject_id` (the append-only event tier).
    * **rollup** — `drl_driver_load_count`: per-driver dispatch counts over aud_event
      (the derived aggregate a pre-shred rollup could resurrect the driver from).
    * **oban job args** — a `Driftwood.Jobs.DispatchWorker` job carrying the driver id
      in its args (token-only).
    * **audit chain** — a second-party REVEAL on the driver (request → approve →
      reveal) drives `aud_chain` entries; the erasure appends the `erasure` entry.
    * **registered non_pii!** — `drv_cdl_state` / `drv_cdl_expiry` (the carve-out
      key-shred cannot reach; erased by row-level redaction).
    * **wide-event sink / trace-sink** — schema-level (token/bounded-id/pseudonym
      only); the pseudonym unlinks on shred.

  ## Running the oracle (the auditor CLI contract)

  `run_oracle_cli/2` shells out to the REAL mix task exactly as an auditor would:

      mix samen.verify.no_plaintext_pii --subject <uuid> --tiers all \\
        --replica none --domain Driftwood.Crm --domain Driftwood.Freight \\
        --domain Driftwood.Aggregate

  It returns `{output, exit_code}`. Post-shred a properly-erased driver EXITS 0 with a
  full slate of positive `:pass` attestations; a leak in any tier EXITS 1.

  ## KMS keystore sharing (why the game-day pins the store)

  The seed+shred and the oracle CLI are SEPARATE OS processes. The KMS attestation
  tier reads the wrapped-DEK / tombstone store as the system of record — so both
  processes MUST read the SAME FileBacked store, or the CLI sees a fresh never-keyed
  store and mis-reports `:absent`. The game-day script pins `:kms_key_dir` to a fixed
  project-local scratch dir and exports `DRIFTWOOD_KMS_KEY_DIR` so the subprocess's
  `config/test.exs` picks up the identical store. (Deploy seam: real AWS KMS is an
  operator TODO — the store is external to Postgres either way, so the ADR-001
  key-absence-from-PITR guarantee is identical.)
