# pitr_drill.exs — the app-context arm of the T5.5 PITR / reverse-migration
# GAME-DAY #2 LOCAL SIMULATION drill against a PRODUCTION-SIZED Driftwood dataset.
#
# Run as:  MIX_ENV=drill DRILL_DB=<db> DRIFTWOOD_KMS_KEY_DIR=<dir> \
#            mix run --no-start priv/drills/pitr_drill.exs <phase>
#
# This is the Driftwood adaptation of demo/priv/drills/pitr_drill.exs (the T2.5
# machinery). It reuses the exact same drill grammar; the DIFFERENCES are:
#   * the dataset is PRODUCTION-SIZED (thousands of loads/settlements/drivers across
#     several tenants), committed so a real pg_dump captures it;
#   * the load-bearing validation is a SETTLEMENT-INTEGRITY check — it re-derives
#     `net_payable = max((linehaul+fuel+accessorial) − advances − factoring_fee −
#     claims, 0)` in SQL from the stored cents columns over the WHOLE dataset and
#     asserts it is consistent + non-empty (design §3 netting math);
#   * the BAD contract drops `stl_advances_cents` — a load-bearing settlement INPUT.
#     Dropping it silently zeroes advances, INFLATING net_payable (a freight broker
#     over-paying carriers). This is the freight-brokerage form of the "bad contract
#     that ran" incident.
#
# Phases (each is one measured, scripted step the bash orchestrator drives):
#   migrate      — migrate DRILL_DB to the current Driftwood schema (all CI
#                  migrations), then GENERATE the production-sized dataset and seed a
#                  real CDL-bearing driver into the vault (ciphertext in Postgres;
#                  wrapped DEK in the EXTERNAL key dir).
#   expand       — apply the reversible drill EXPAND (adds stl_settlement_note) whose
#                  tested down/0 recovery ARM (i) uses.
#   bad_contract — apply the BAD contract: DROP COLUMN stl_advances_cents (a
#                  load-bearing settlement input). Irreversible by down/0 (the data
#                  in the dropped column is gone) — covered by PITR, not down/0.
#   detect       — run the settlement-integrity harness; EXIT non-zero if the bad
#                  contract has broken settlement integrity (the "detect" step).
#   reverse      — recovery ARM (i): reverse the EXPAND via its tested down/0, then
#                  forward-fix (re-add the dropped column) and re-validate. EXIT 0 iff
#                  the expand column is gone AND settlement integrity holds again.
#   validate     — recovery ARM (ii): validate settlement integrity against DRILL_DB
#                  (the orchestrator points it at the RESTORED pre-contract DB). EXIT
#                  non-zero (fail closed) on any integrity failure — the RED PATH.
#   keystore     — ARM (ii) key-store exclusion (T5.5 (c)): assert the restored DB
#                  decrypts NOTHING (the driver CDL) when the external key dir is
#                  empty — a DB-only restore never resurrects a shredded/absent key.
