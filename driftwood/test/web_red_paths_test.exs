defmodule Driftwood.WebRedPathsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  RED-PATH matrix re-run against the LIVE Driftwood web planes (T5.3). Each guarantee
  ships a MUST-FAIL assertion plus a non-vacuous control:

    * masked impersonation renders `••••` for driver name + CDL, NEVER plaintext (with a
      positive control: the real non-PII data shape IS present);
    * an UNGRANTED reveal DENIES (control: a distinct-party grant succeeds);
    * the token-blind AGGREGATE view exposes NO PII (control: it DOES show cross-tenant
      counts/MRR);
    * an FMCSA-blocked (expired-card) driver CANNOT be dispatched from the UI action
      (control: a compliant driver's Dispatch button is enabled);
    * an expired / never-opened impersonation session renders access-denied, NO data.

  The anti-tautology probe on the live masked-render path is documented in
  `test/web_anti_tautology_probe.md` (scratch-dir sabotage → flip confirmed → reverted).
