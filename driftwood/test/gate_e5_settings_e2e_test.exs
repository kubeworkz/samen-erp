defmodule Driftwood.GateE5SettingsE2ETest do
  @moduledoc """
  GATE PROBE (WS-E E5.4) — the self-serve settings surface end-to-end on a REAL host
  (Driftwood): the `samen_settings_routes` macro mount + the settings engines
  (`Samen.Web.Settings.Profile` / `ApiKeys`) over Driftwood's Identity namespace
  (`Driftwood.Operator.{User,ApiKey,Membership}`). Proves at ≈0 authored settings LOC:

    * the profile self-edit routes through the vault chokepoint — a tenant self-edit
      vault-routes `full_name` to `vt_*`; an operator-impersonation plaintext PII write
      is refused (AC-G18-2);
    * API-key mint is show-once / digest-only, authority bounded by the minter ceiling
      (AC-G18-3/4);
    * no framework auth is invented (the Security surface reads the real accountability
      source; AC-G18-5).

  A gate artifact, not part of the shipped suites.
