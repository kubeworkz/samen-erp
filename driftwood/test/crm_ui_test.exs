defmodule Driftwood.CrmUiTest do
  @moduledoc """
  CRM UI smoke tests — the inherited CRM module rendered by the FRAMEWORK (ADR-009).

  The CRM pages are no longer driftwood-local: they are `Samen.Web.CRM.{Companies,Contacts,
  Pipeline}Live`, MOUNTED by `DriftwoodWeb.Router` (`samen_module_routes :crm, Driftwood.Crm,
  repo: Driftwood.Repo`) over Driftwood's materialized `Driftwood.Crm.*` resources. The DEEP
  render/masking coverage now lives in samen_web's own suite (`web/crm_render_test.exs`,
  independent of any vertical). These driftwood-side tests prove Driftwood's OWN MOUNT is
  correct — the framework LiveViews render Driftwood's rows on both planes:

    1. Each mounted CRM page renders with Driftwood's seeded rows (non-vacuous).
    2. MASKING (the tenant-owner rule, kept end-to-end over the driftwood mount):
       a. TENANT plane — a contact's name/email/phone render IN THE CLEAR (the org reads
          its own contacts' PII, no operator reveal grant).
       b. OPERATOR / impersonation plane — the SAME contact renders •••• and the plaintext
          PII is ABSENT. ONE code path (`Samen.Web.CRM.ContactsLive.load/2`), differing only
          in the mount's plane.

  The mount + render is driven through `Driftwood.DataCase.{driftwood_mount,render_framework}`,
  which builds the identical `Samen.Web.Mount` the router builds and renders the framework
  LiveView over it — the exact code path the mounted route runs.
