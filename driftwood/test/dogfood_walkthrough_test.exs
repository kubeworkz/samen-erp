defmodule Driftwood.DogfoodWalkthroughTest do
  @moduledoc """
  The scripted end-to-end DOGFOOD walkthrough (T5.3 clause (c)) — drives the WHOLE
  Driftwood story with assertions, and renders the LIVE LiveViews' HEEx:

    1. create a brokerage tenant → add carriers/shippers/drivers/loads;
    2. DISPATCH the compliant driver (FMCSA gate passes);
    3. SETTLE (the reshaped two-sided money: linehaul − advances − factoring − claims);
    4. rebuild the tenant rollup + the cross-tenant aggregate;
    5. the broker DASHBOARD renders the rollup-backed summary (never a raw scan);
    6. the broker ROSTER + operator IMPERSONATION render driver PII as `••••`;
    7. an operator opens MASKED impersonation and sees the REAL roster/load board (••••);
    8. a distinct-party REVEAL grant unmasks ONE driver's CDL end-to-end;
    9. the token-blind AGGREGATE view shows cross-tenant load volume / MRR with NO PII.

  The human-followable version is `docs/driftwood-dogfood.md` (drives the same steps
  against the running server).
