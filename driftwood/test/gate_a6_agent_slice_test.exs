defmodule Driftwood.GateA6AgentSliceTest do
  @moduledoc """
  GATE PROBE — ADR-047 batch **A6**, the v1 vertical slice (§9#7 TAKEN: *driftwood support
  triage*), end to end on a REAL host: **agent run → masked read → write PROPOSAL → the
  tenant decision card → a human's approve click → the write EXECUTES as that human →
  the run resumes and completes**, all keyless under `Samen.AI.Provider.Scripted`.

  This is the proof A5 could not give. `samen_web`'s scratch host mounts no `apv_approval`
  resource, so the click-to-EXECUTE round trip and the decision card's id-discrimination
  arm were both unprovable there (the A5 verifier's R-A5-5). Driftwood has a real E3
  engine, a real Identity spine, and — as of A6 — real agent wiring, so both land here.

  ## What the slice ADOPTS versus what it AUTHORS (the ≈0-LOC leverage guard)

  Authored in this vertical: `Driftwood.Support.TriageAgent`'s definition and ONE
  `samen_ai_routes` router call. Everything the tests below drive — the loop, the four-way
  tool intersection, EG2 scrubbing, the propose-then-approve park, the approval engine, the
  approver-membership resolution, the run list / run detail / transcript / turn log /
  decision card, and the operator agent-health page — is framework code the vertical did
  not write. `test "LEVERAGE GUARD"` pins that with a line count that fails if it drifts.

  ## The reds, each with its positive control (anti-tautology)

    * an UNAUTHENTICATED session cannot decide (the card refuses before the engine);
    * the SYNTHETIC per-org `broker:<org_id>` principal — what A5's card actually acted as
      — is not a member and cannot decide (R-A5-3, shipped red);
    * a crafted `phx-value-id` naming ANOTHER run's real pending approval refuses
      (**the id-discrimination arm** R-A5-5 named as owed live), and that other run's
      target record stays unmutated;
    * a `:viewer`-role member's approve is refused by the TARGET's `RoleAtLeast :member`
      gate and the whole decision rolls back — proving the approver's REAL role rides the
      execution, not a synthesized `:member`;
    * a rejection terminates the run `:rejected` and executes nothing.

  Positive controls: the same click by a real `:admin` member executes exactly once, the
  record carries the proposed owner, the audit chain names that human, and the run reaches
  `:succeeded`.
