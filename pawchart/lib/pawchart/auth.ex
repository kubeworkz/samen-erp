defmodule PawChart.Auth do
  @moduledoc """
  PawChart's operator-ROLE authority seam (T146 / T157) — the REAL operator roster resolver
  wired as `config :pawchart, :operator_authority, {PawChart.Auth, :operator_role, [:pawchart]}`.

  This is the load-bearing T157 requirement: pawchart's operator plane is gated by a REAL roster
  (a configured `:operator_roster` mapping principal → role), NOT the framework dev fallback
  (`Samen.Web.Operator.Authz.dev_operator_role/2`). The roster path grants a LISTED principal its
  role and refuses an UNLISTED one — and it does so even when the dev convenience is disarmed
  (`auth_required?: true`), so a prod-armed pawchart refuses every principal absent from the roster.

  Auth is host-owned (ADR-029). A production deploy provisions `:operator_roster` (or swaps
  `operator_role/2` for real operator `Membership` rows); the seam and the `Samen.Web.Operator.Authz`
  / `Samen.Web.AuthGate` consumers stay exactly the same underneath. Mirrors `Driftwood.Auth`'s
  operator-role seam, scoped to the `:pawchart` product.

  ## Tenant membership seam (PP-2, Batch 5a)

  `authorized_org_ids/1` is the `:authorized_orgs` membership seam `Samen.Web.CurrentOrg.resolve/3`
  calls on an ARMED host to constrain the tenant actor to the authenticated user's OWN orgs. Because
  pawchart is a REAL authenticated product (operator ruling), this resolves from REAL
  `Identity.Membership` rows on `PawChart.Operator` (the SAME spine `samen_auth_routes` /
  `samen_settings_routes` mount) — NOT a static credential map. An unknown user → `[]` (deny). This
  is the "a real deploy points it at Identity.Membership rows" completion `Driftwood.Auth`'s
  reference docstring describes.
