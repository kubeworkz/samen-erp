defmodule PawChartWeb.Router do
  @moduledoc """
  The PawChart host router (ADR-009 reuse proof).

  The inherited-80% product UI (CRM / Billing / Support) is MOUNTED from `samen_web`
  in THREE lines — `samen_module_routes/3` per scope. PawChart supplies the three host
  facts (namespace + repo) and the framework derives all LiveView routes:

      samen_module_routes(:crm,     PawChart.Crm,     repo: PawChart.Repo)
      samen_module_routes(:billing, PawChart.Billing, repo: PawChart.Repo)
      samen_module_routes(:support, PawChart.Support, repo: PawChart.Repo)

  REUSE MEASUREMENT (the thesis proof):
    * 3 lines mount CRM (3 pages: companies, contacts, pipeline)
    * 3 lines mount Billing (3 pages: overview, invoices, plans)
    * 3 lines mount Support (2 pages: tickets, ticket detail)
    = 3 lines → 8 inherited pages, 0 PawChart LiveView modules authored.

  The vertical 20% (clinical console for the clinic's own patients/pets) would be a
  PawChart-local LiveView — a follow-on scope outside this task. This router is already
  a complete working product UI for the three universal scopes.

  Labels customize the workspace title / glyph for the PawChart brand (the clinic
  sidebar shows "Happy Paws" not the framework default "Workspace").

  # `operator_authority` is the REAL roster seam (T146/T157): `PawChart.Auth.operator_role/2`
  # resolves the configured `:operator_roster` (a production-shaped resolver), NOT the framework
  # dev fallback. `org_directory` feeds the workspace switcher over the operator org's accounts.

  # PP-2 (Batch 5a PAWCHART-SPINE) — the current-org data-on-the-mount labels EVERY PII-bearing
  # tenant/shared mount carries, so pawchart is a properly-authenticated tenant host (mirroring
  # driftwood's `@current_org_labels`). A module attribute (compile-time literal usable inside the
  # `samen_module_routes` macro expansion); every value is session-safe (uuids + MFAs of atoms).
  #
  #   :default_org_id  — the dev default (Happy Paws Clinic), so a page with no ?org renders a
  #     populated org (resolution step 3), never a dead-end.
  #   :org_directory   — the `{mod,fun,args}` the framework switcher + name resolution read
  #     (`PawChart.Directory.orgs/0` → `[{tenant_org_id, name}]` over the operator accounts).
  #   :authn           — `{:app_env, :pawchart, :auth_required?}`: OFF in dev/test (the query-param
  #     convenience identity stays), ON in prod (the actor is derived ONLY from an authenticated
  #     session). This is the label the Batch-1 fail-closed `CurrentOrg.resolve/3` consults; its
  #     PRESENCE is what the tenant-authn coverage guard requires of a real product.
  #   :authorized_orgs — the membership seam `Samen.Web.CurrentOrg` calls to constrain the tenant
  #     actor to the authenticated user's OWN orgs (`PawChart.Auth.authorized_org_ids/1` over REAL
  #     `PawChart.Operator` Membership rows).
  #   :identity_namespace — (PP-5 / Batch 2 TENANT-ROLE) the Identity scope the tenant-plane Billing
  #     surface reads the caller's REAL per-org Membership role from (the `PawChart.Operator.{User,
  #     Membership}` spine — the SAME namespace `samen_settings_routes` mounts). Billing lives in its
  #     own scope namespace (`PawChart.Billing`), which materializes no Membership, so the admin-gated
  #     checkout/portal writes derive the acting role through this sibling seam.
  #   :operator_workspace / :seed_command — the shared cross-plane chrome (switcher return link,
  #     no-org card) derives pawchart's OWN boundary names, not the framework-neutral default.
  #   :host_nav_extra — (PP-4 / Batch 5b CLINIC-SURFACE) the "host supplies DATA, framework
  #     renders it" nav seam (`Samen.UI.host_nav_extra/1`, same pattern as driftwood's freight
  #     "Operations" group): `PawChartWeb.ClinicLive.clinic_nav_data/1` returns the "Clinic" nav
  #     group, so the vet vertical's namesake surface (`/clinic`) is reachable from EVERY framework
  #     module sidebar (CRM/Billing/Support/…), not only its own page. Called as
  #     `apply(mod, fun, args ++ [org_id])`, so `clinic_nav_data/1` is arity 1.

  # T142 (folded into T157, per operator ruling) — the AI-plane MCP server endpoint (ADR-043 §9),

  # digests the bearer token (SHA-256) and confirms it against the stored per-operator token digest
  # with `Plug.Crypto.secure_compare/2`, returning a `%Samen.Scope{}` scoped to the token owner's org
  # (org-A token cannot reach org-B data). Bare `forward` (no browser session/CSRF) — auth is the
  # bearer token alone; unauth / forged / revoked ⇒ 401 (proven by the e2e auth test).
