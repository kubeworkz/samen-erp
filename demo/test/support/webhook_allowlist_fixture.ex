  Test-support domain for the F3.6 webhook opt-in allowlist red paths.

  jsonb bag AND a `json_api do show_fields([…]) end` allowlist that DELIBERATELY does
  NOT include `:custom` (nor `org_id`/`inserted_at`/`updated_at`). It exists so the
  webhook payload serializer can be exercised end-to-end against a real Ash resource
  whose `show_fields` omits the `custom` bag — proving the bag is ABSENT from the
  outbound payload even when populated.

  F3.6 fixture — a resource with a Tier-1 `:custom` bag and an opt-in `show_fields`
  allowlist that OMITS the bag.

  `show_fields([:id, :display_name])` is the opt-in allowlist. Fields present on the
  resource but ABSENT from that list — `:custom` (the Tier-1 jsonb bag),
  `:internal_label`, plus the injected `org_id`/`inserted_at`/`updated_at` — must be
  ABSENT from the webhook payload by omission.

  The payload serializer reads attributes + `show_fields` off the resource module and
  reads values off the in-memory record struct, so the red-path tests build payloads
  from structs WITHOUT a DB round-trip (no migration needed for this fixture).
