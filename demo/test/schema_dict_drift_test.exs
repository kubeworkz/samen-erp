defmodule Demo.SchemaDictDriftTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Guards the committed `demo/schema.dict.json` against staleness — the same
  invariant `demo/ci.sh` step 1b ("schema.dict.json drift check") enforces, but
  as a fast unit test so drift is caught in the suite (not only in the full gate).

  ## Why this test exists (B2-P1-schema-dict-stale)

  B1 shipped the `mov_subscription_event` resource (the append-only movement
  ledger) + its migration but never regenerated `schema.dict.json`, so the
  committed artifact was missing the `Demo.BillingScope.SubscriptionEvent`
  table block. The next full-gate run (B2) went RED at step 1b. This test is
  the in-suite tripwire for that class of regression: ship a resource, forget
  the dict, and the suite is red *before* the gate is.

  The drift check compares the committed file byte-for-byte against a freshly
  built dict from the live domain config — resolved exactly like
  `mix samen.catalog.dump` (`Application.get_env(:ash, :domains)`).
