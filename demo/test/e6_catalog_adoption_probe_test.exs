defmodule Demo.E6CatalogAdoptionProbeTest do
  @moduledoc """
  T37h — the catalog-driven E6 adoption probe (ADR-040 §5.9's T37h split, T37 c1).
  Closes the T37 adoption sweep (T36 + T37a–g all DONE+CONFIRMED) with the standing
  guard the roster table itself promises: **every user-managed noun in the catalog is
  EITHER `archivable: true` OR explicitly excluded with a §5.9 exclusion class** — so
  a resource can never silently fall through the roster (no adopter forgets to flip
  it, no exclusion goes undocumented).

  ## What is scanned, and why

  This probe walks `Samen.Catalog.resource_modules/1` over the EIGHT domains ADR-040
  §5.9's table actually classifies and demo mounts: `Demo.Analytics`,
  `Demo.BillingScope`, `Demo.CmsScope`, `Demo.CrmScope`, `Demo.Identity`,
  `Demo.MarketingScope`, `Demo.PrimitivesScope`, `Demo.SupportScope`. Demo mounts
  several OTHER scopes too (`Demo.Crm` legacy, `Demo.WorkScope`, `Demo.CalendarScope`,
  `Demo.DocsScope`, `Demo.Tags`, `Demo.LocationsScope`, `Demo.SalesOps`,
  `Demo.Aggregate`) — those are deliberately NOT scanned here: §5.9's table does not
  classify them (they are separate, later-landed BATON scopes outside the E6 sweep's
  charter), so holding THIS probe to "every resource in `:samen_core, :ash_domains`"
  would force a classification call this task has no authority to make. Chat
  (`samen_web`'s T37e rider) is proven separately in
  `samen_web/test/samen/scopes/chat_catalog_adoption_probe_test.exs` — demo does not
  mount the Chat scope. `automation`'s `workflow`/`run`/`reminder`/`escalation`
  (§5.9's table also lists this scope) are likewise NOT scanned: `Samen.Scopes.Automation`
  is not mounted by ANY host today (`grep -rn Automation */config/config.exs` — zero
  hits; only samen_core/samen_web TEST fixtures use it), so it never appears in a real
  catalog for this probe to walk — a pre-existing gap this probe surfaces in its
  moduledoc rather than silently working around, since flipping `archivable: true` on
  `Workflow` is a substrate change outside T37h's `Samen.Files`/gen/UI/probe charter
  (T37a–f's per-scope pattern is the right vehicle for it, not this task).

  ## The roster fixture — §5.9's table, verbatim, not re-derived

  `@roster` below is a direct transcription of ADR-040 §5.9's table (the Archivable /
  Excluded columns) — the handoff's own instruction ("use §5.9's table as the test
  fixture directly — don't re-derive the classification"). Each entry is
  `{domain, resource, status}` where `status` is `:archivable` or `{:excluded, class}`
  (`class` mirrors the table's parenthetical: `:ledger` (L), `:mirror` (M),
  `:mirror_derived` (M — derived), `:auth` (A), `:settings`, `:never`).

  ## The three guarantees proven

    1. **Every roster-archivable resource IS archivable** (`archivable?/1 == true`).
    2. **Every roster-excluded resource is NOT archivable**, and its class is on record
       here (against §5.9's own table — not re-derived).
    3. **Nothing falls through**: for EACH of the eight domains, the LIVE catalog walk
       (`Samen.Catalog.resource_modules/1`, not this file's `@roster` list) is set-
       equal to `archivable ∪ excluded` for that domain. A resource added to a scope
       tomorrow with NEITHER `archivable: true` NOR a `@roster` entry FAILS this test
       immediately — the structural "nothing silently falls through" guarantee. The
       anti-tautology proof that this check is real (not vacuously true because the
       live catalog always matches whatever this file says) lives in the last
       `describe` block: it calls the SAME accounting helper against a deliberately
       INCOMPLETE fixture and asserts it raises.
