  @moduledoc """
  T4.6 — ADVERSARIAL suite, category 3: AGGREGATE DIFFERENCING + K-ANON / L-DIVERSITY
  BYPASS ATTEMPTS.

  Consolidated Phase-4 attack surface (plan §6.3 "Aggregate differencing"), driven
  against the REAL `Demo.Aggregate` token-blind projections read ONLY through the
  `Samen.Aggregate.read_all/2` chokepoint (which routes every row set through
  `Samen.Aggregate.Privacy` — the k-anon + l-diversity floors). Demo floor: k=2 / l=2.

  Bypass vectors attacked (the operator tries to route AROUND the suppression):

    (1) FILTER bypass — an `Ash.Query.filter` narrowing the aggregate read to a
        count-of-one cohort. The filter runs at the DB, but the suppression rides the
        chokepoint's post-read pass, so the isolated cohort is STILL suppressed.
    (2) INCLUDE / raw-read bypass — reading the projection resource directly with
        `Ash.read` (skipping `read_all`) is DENIED by `AggregateActorOnly` for a
        non-aggregate actor; and even the aggregate actor's direct `Ash.read` returns
        the RAW projection rows WITHOUT the floor — which is precisely why the operator
        surface (dashboard) reads ONLY through `read_all`. This test proves the
        chokepoint is the only floor-applying path AND that the domain read is
        default-deny for everyone else.
    (3) REPEATED / DIFFERENCING queries — two overlapping cohort reads isolating one
        subject. The k-anon floor catches the isolating (count-of-one) side; the
        per-cohort ledger records BOTH reads (collusion-resistant granularity — not
        per-actor). With enforcement OFF (the default) the subtler above-floor
        differencing residue is documented HONESTLY (the ledger observes, it does not
        block).
    (4) L-DIVERSITY homogeneity bypass — a homogeneous cohort (>= k but 1 distinct
        sensitive value) is SUPPRESSED under l-diversity, so an operator cannot read a
        big-but-uniform cohort to learn every member's sensitive value.
    (5) T6.6 BUDGET ENFORCEMENT (opt-in) — with the enforcing per-cohort budget ON, the
        above-floor differencing residue from (3) is now BLOCKED: a repeated read of an
        above-k cohort past its budget is SUPPRESSED (`reason: :query_budget`), and two
        colluding actors share ONE cohort budget. This is the cross-query defence
        promoted from accounting-only (T4.5) to enforcing (T6.6). The FORMAL DP
        composition guarantee remains posture — see the T6.6 report.

  POSITIVE CONTROL throughout: a >=k, l-diverse cohort in the SAME read IS released —
  so every suppression is the floor firing on cohort shape, not an always-suppress.
