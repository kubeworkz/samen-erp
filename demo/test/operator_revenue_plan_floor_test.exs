  @moduledoc """
  WS-B / B3 — AC-G7-9 (M/RP): the CROSS-TENANT MRR-by-plan view goes through the
  token-blind `operator_aggregate` path UNDER the k-anon floor, proven against the
  REAL aggregate plane on the exact loader the framework `RevenueLive` consumes
  (`Demo.OperatorDashboard.revenue_plan_cohorts/0`, wired as `revenue_plan_loader:`).

  Demo floor config: k=2 (small dogfood datasets; production keeps k=5 — the SAME
  `Samen.Aggregate.Privacy` floor either way, only the config differs).

    * **Below-floor suppresses** — a plan cohort with tenant_count < k reaches the
      loader with `mrr_cents` = `%Suppressed{}`; the exact revenue NEVER leaves the
      chokepoint.
    * **Positive control** — a cohort at/above the floor is released with its exact
      value (the suppression is not an always-⊘).
    * **SABOTAGE / anti-tautology flip** — the SAME read with the floor sabotaged
      (`k: 1` at the chokepoint, i.e. the floor effectively removed) RELEASES the
      below-floor cohort's exact value. That flips the suppression assertion above:
      the value demonstrably exists and is withheld ONLY by the floor — the
      suppression test is load-bearing, not vacuous.
