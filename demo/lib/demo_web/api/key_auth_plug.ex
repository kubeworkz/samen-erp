defmodule DemoWeb.Api.KeyAuthPlug do
  @moduledoc """
  Resolve the inbound `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` into a `%Samen.Scope{}`
  actor and set it on the conn (T3.11; doc §external-surface "two key classes").

  ## The two key classes (doc §external-surface)

  An `api_key` is bound to exactly one of two planes; the SAME Ash policy stack gates
  both (the key can never out-reach its actor). This plug reads the plane off the
  persisted `Demo.Identity.ApiKey` row and builds the actor accordingly:

    * `:tenant`   — org-bound. Acts as the tenant over its OWN org's data. Reads its
      own org's PII in clear per the tenant's RBAC, with NO operator reveal grant
      (the reveal seam is operator-scoped; it does not sit between a tenant and its
      own records). The actor carries the key's `org_id`, so the org-scope policy
      isolates it to that org — a cross-org request returns zero rows.
    * `:operator` — the control-plane / cross-tenant class. Masked by default: a
      subject's vaulted plaintext is ABSENT (or `••••`) unless an operator reveal
      grant covers it. The actor is flagged `plane: :operator` so the serialization
      masking layer (`DemoWeb.Api.OperatorMask`) strips vaulted fields absent a grant.

  ## The actor shape

  The built actor is the canonical `%Samen.Scope{}` actor map (id/org_id/role) — the
  shape the T3.1 policies already read — PLUS two API-only keys the API layer reads:

    * `:plane`   — `:tenant | :operator` (drives the masking rule).
    * `:api_key` — the `Samen.Scope.ApiKey` key map (org_id/plane/scopes/minter_role),
      so `Samen.Scope.ApiKey.authorized?/4` can enforce the key's declared scopes AND
      the actor ceiling. A key can never out-reach the membership that minted it.

  The actor's `:role` is the key's `minter_role` — the key inherits its minter's rank
  (a viewer-minted key is read-only regardless of its declared scopes; RBAC on the
  resource sees this role).

  ## Digest, not plaintext

  The key row stores only a SHA-256 digest of the key (`key_token_digest`); the raw
  key is shown once at mint and never persisted in clear. This plug digests the
  presented bearer token the same way and looks the row up by digest — a constant
  set of DB reads, no plaintext key at rest.

  Fail closed: a missing/malformed/unknown/revoked key sets NO actor. Downstream, an
  actor-less request hits the org-scope policy's nil-org branch and sees zero rows.
