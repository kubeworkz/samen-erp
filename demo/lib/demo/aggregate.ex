defmodule Demo.Aggregate do
  @moduledoc """
  The demo's **token-blind aggregate plane** domain (T4.2; doc §control "Two planes,
  two operator paths").

  This is a SEPARATE, DEFAULT-DENY Ash domain. Its only admissible actor is the
  singleton `Samen.Aggregate.Actor` (`operator_aggregate`, no `org_id`) — every
  resource here carries a `policy always() do authorize_if
  Samen.Policy.AggregateActorOnly end` block (default deny; no `authorize_if
  always()` fallthrough). A tenant / impersonation / api_key actor reading this
  domain is refused.

  ## Cross-tenant projections (vault-excluded, no pii_ columns)

  Its resources project ONLY vault-excluded, non-PII columns from cross-tenant
  rollup/summary tables (`rol_*`):

    * `Demo.Aggregate.MrrByTier` (`rol_mrr_by_tier`) — cross-tenant MRR (Monthly
      Recurring Revenue) rolled up from the Billing subscription/plan rows, grouped
      by plan tier. Columns: tier (bounded enum), tenant_count (int), mrr_cents
      (int) — a count and a number, never a subject.

    * `Demo.Aggregate.TicketQueueDepth` (`rol_ticket_queue_depth`) — cross-tenant
      support-queue depths rolled up from the Support ticket rows, grouped by
      status. Columns: status (bounded enum), depth (int) — a count, never a
      subject.

    * `Demo.Aggregate.HealthByBand` (`ahb_health_by_band`) — cross-tenant account
      count per health BAND ("how many accounts are at-risk across the fleet";
      design §2.3, ADR-019 §5, AC-G17-6). Columns: band (bounded enum),
      account_count (int) — a count, never a subject. The k-anon floor suppresses a
      band with <5 accounts.

  The first two are the doc examples: "Cross-tenant views (MRR, queues)". All three are
  `use Samen.Aggregate.Resource`, so the C7 `NoPiiColumns` verifier FAILS the build
  if either declares a `pii_attribute`, a vault, a `pii_`-shaped column, or a
  relationship reaching a PII-bearing resource. Their physical tables contain no
  `pii_` columns (asserted via `information_schema` in the T4.2 tests + the
  whole-app `mix samen.verify.no_pii_columns` backstop).

  ## Reads go through `Samen.Aggregate`

  Operator cross-tenant dashboards read ONLY through `Samen.Aggregate.read_all/2` /
  `read/3` with the aggregate actor — the mutually-exclusive path from masked
  impersonation (single-org, T4.1). The aggregate actor can never cross the reveal
  seam (`Samen.Reveal` refuses it) and can never read a tenant-plane resource
  (org-less → OrgScope filters to zero rows).

  with fewer than `k` (=5 in production) accounts across the fleet renders
  `%Suppressed{}` — the operator can never learn "there is exactly 1 critical
  account" (which, joined with any side channel, re-identifies it).
