defmodule Demo.OperatorDashboard do
  @moduledoc """
  The operator's **cross-tenant dashboard** (T4.2 clause (d); doc §control "Cross-
  tenant views (MRR, queues) run on a separate token-blind actor").

  This is the SEPARATE, mutually-exclusive path from masked impersonation (T4.1,
  single-org). It reads ONLY through the token-blind aggregate domain
  (`Demo.Aggregate`) via `Samen.Aggregate.read_all/2` with the singleton aggregate
  actor. There is no other data path here — the dashboard NEVER reaches a
  tenant-plane resource directly, never opens an impersonation session, never
  reveals. It sees counts and MRR totals across all tenants, and can never see a
  subject:

    * `Samen.Reveal.reveal/5` refuses the aggregate actor structurally.
    * `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` filters the org-less aggregate actor to zero rows on
      every tenant-plane resource.
    * The aggregate domain's resources are C7-verified to have no `pii_` columns.

  ## The two dashboard views (the doc's two examples)

    * `mrr/0` — total cross-tenant MRR (sum of `mrr_cents` across tiers) plus the
      per-tier breakdown.
    * `queue_depths/0` — support-queue depth per status across all tenants.

  ## T4.5 privacy floors are applied by the read path, not here

  Both views read through `Samen.Aggregate.read_all/2`, which enforces the k-anonymity
  and l-diversity floors before returning rows: a tier whose `tenant_count < k` (a
  count-of-one tier, which would leak one tenant's exact revenue) comes back with
  `mrr_cents` = `%Samen.Aggregate.Suppressed{}`, and a status cohort with `depth < k`
  or `distinct_priorities < l` (homogeneous priorities) comes back with `depth`
  suppressed. The dashboard treats a `%Suppressed{}` cell as withheld — it never sums a
  suppressed value into the cross-tenant total (that would re-leak it), and it surfaces
  the suppression to the operator as `⊘`.
