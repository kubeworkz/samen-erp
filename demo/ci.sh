#      backstop to the compile-time NoPanColumns verifier+transformer (base-wired into
#      EVERY Samen resource): (a) re-runs the shape rule on every resource in every
#      configured domain, (b) asserts via information_schema that every resource's

#     floors are ENFORCEABLE on it. A new cross-tenant projection that forgot its cohort
#     spec fails closed only at read time (:no_cohort_spec) — this turns "every aggregate
#     cell is floor-protected" into a gated invariant. It gates the ENFORCED floor only;
#     the cross-query budget / DP layer is posture under construction (plan T6.6) and is
#     deliberately NOT gated here (the query-budget ledger is a WARN-not-enforce scaffold).

#      (the permanent canary red-team across EG1–EG6, RP-AI-9/10) runs under samen_core's

#     (DB CHECK + policy), expired grant, renew-in-place, grant-row/audit-chain tamper,
#     requestor-approver collusion (documented residue, ASSERTED audit-visible);
#     (3) aggregate differencing + k-anon/l-div bypass (filters, includes, repeated
#     queries); (4) audit tamper (edit/delete/rewrite vs chain + WORM anchor);

#     local-entry tamper); (6) crypto-shred completeness against the CONTROL-PLANE tiers
#     (aud_chain event survives post-shred, subject ciphertext undecryptable; the
#     post-shred destruction oracle passes on a control-plane-seeded subject — this is
#     the "extend the oracle run in CI" assertion). Every case carries a POSITIVE CONTROL
