# ADR-047 — The AI agent loop: first-party durable multi-step tool use, governed by the EG2 egress class

- **Status:** **ACCEPTED** (2026-08-17 — batch **A7** landed, the final BATON batch; the §9
  operator decisions were **ratified 2026-08-14 — all seven TAKEN as recommended**, and A1–A7
  are all shipped and gated GREEN).
- **Date:** 2026-08-14 (accepted 2026-08-17)
- **Build status:** **BUILT — A1–A7 all shipped, each behind its own adversarial gate.** The ADR
  itself authored no product code (docs-only per the decompose-cross-cutting-changes rule); the
  seven BATON batches §8 sequences built the loop, adding **zero dependencies**. A7 (the gates)
  ships `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` (the F-4 raw-spawn AST lock + coverage floor),
  `ai_prompt_masking` checks (d)/(e), the permanent red-team EG2 arm, and `mix samen.gen.agent`
  + its `gen_agent_probe.exs` — SCHEMA: NONE (no abbrev, no migration, zero new dependencies).
- **Task:** Close the **EG2 gap** recorded by the Jido evaluation (`_orch/jido-eval-report.md`
  §2.3 / §4): ADR-043 §3.1 declares EG2 — *"tool/function definitions, tool args, and
  tool-result re-entry into a prompt"* — a governed egress class, and the chokepoint already
  ships `:history` with per-turn grant re-scrub (§3.2a) **precisely to serve multi-turn loops**,
  but nothing implements it. Every shipped AI surface is single-shot. Close it **first-party**,
  inside the AST anti-bypass probe's and the sabotage harness's coverage.
- **Deciders:** the operator, for the seven decisions in **§9** (autonomous-write policy, grant
  plaintext in a persisted transcript, default cost budgets, transcript retention, streaming
  deferral, verifier placement, and the v1 slice) — **all seven ratified 2026-08-14 exactly as
  recommended and marked TAKEN in §9**. Everything else is recorded design a BATON builder
  executes without re-deriving.
- **Consumes (binding inputs):**
  - **ADR-043 §3.1 EG2** — the declared-but-unimplemented egress class this ADR implements;
    **INV-7** (§3.1), the chokepoint pipeline (§3.2), the **per-turn history re-scrub** (§3.2a),
    the **EG6** observability contract (§3.2b), **§6.1** masked-by-default egress +
    `grant_plaintext_egress`, **§6.2** *"AI writes do not exist: AI outputs are drafts and
    proposals … anything with side effects goes through the E3 approvals engine"* — which
    **binds §5.3 of this ADR and is deliberately not amended**, §7.2 (grants never unlock
    persisted egress), §10 (the permanent red-team tier + the ≥90% context-assembly bar).
  - **ADR-039** — the automation engine: `Samen.Automation.Action` (the 8-kind registry),
    `Automation.Compile` → `Reactor.Builder` with per-step compensation, `Automation.Run`
    (AshStateMachine) + `RunRecord`'s bounded-outcome allowlist, `Automation.Health` /
    `Breaker`, `EventCapture`'s same-transaction Oban enqueue, `Automation.Context`.
  - **ADR-037 §5.6 / §5.7 / §5.8 / §5.9** — ash_ai REJECT (hand-built kernel); Reactor,
    AshStateMachine, AshOban ADOPT. The Jido evaluation re-confirmed the same verdict one
    package over: adopting an agent framework moves prompt assembly outside the two gates that
    make samen's AI claims defensible. **This ADR adds no dependency.**
  - **ADR-014 / ADR-024 / ADR-026** — the fail-honest adapter contract. Budget exhaustion,
    provider failure, and tool failure all return honest errors; **no partial answer is ever
    dressed as a result.**
  - **ADR-040 §4** — the E3 approvals engine + the `Samen.Approvals.Gate` face (requester ≠
    approver at both the policy and `<abbrev>_distinct_party` DB-CHECK layers), which is how a
    mutating tool executes.
  - **ADR-046** — the erasure-completeness gate. This ADR must not create a new out-of-envelope
    residue; §7.4 states how the transcript is reached and why the E7 discovery classes are
    unchanged.
  - **ADR-042** — the plane/client model (masking resolved server-side; the LiveView never
    branches on plane). **T144** — the operator-only analytics gate (`Samen.AI.Analytics`
    `platform_actor?/1`, impersonation-refused-first), which constrains which actions may
    become tools (§5.2).
  - **CLAUDE.md** — framework-first ≈0-LOC vertical mounts; the abbrev registry is HANDS-OFF
    (every new resource reserves through `mix samen.abbrev.reserve`, driven by the generator).
- **Binds (implementing batches):** A1–A7 (§8).

## 1 · Context — what exists, what is missing, and the exact size of the hole

**What exists.** `Samen.AI.Chokepoint` (`samen_core/lib/samen/ai/chokepoint.ex`, 539 LOC) is
simultaneously the only site that mints a `%Samen.AI.MaskedPayload{}` and the only site that
invokes a `Samen.AI.Provider` callback. `seal/3` is a fixed-order fail-closed pipeline: resolve
`:bindings` through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution` in egress mode → **re-scrub `:history` against the
current turn's grant state** → assemble → scrub by **allowlist** (`safe_segment?/1` admits only
`vt_`-free binaries, bounded primitives, sealed payloads, and lists thereof; every map, tuple,
keyword list, struct, and atom refuses) → seal. `safe_metadata?/1` extends the same allowlist to
`:grounding`/`:meta` as a bounded map recursion over **keys and values**. Provider errors
normalize to a content-free `{:provider_error, provider}` (EG6); `%MaskedPayload{}` is
Inspect-redacting; `Samen.AI.ChokepointAntiBypassProbeTest` AST-scans **every app's `lib/`** for
out-of-chokepoint constructions; `scripts/sabotages/` carries 239 patches, two of which
(`44-d2-ai-egress-history-remask-bypass`, `45-t65-ai-egress-scrub-shape-blind-tuple-hole`) are
*already* about multi-turn re-scrub and the EG2 tool-args tuple hole.

For orchestration, samen owns: `Samen.Automation.Action` (8 governed kinds), `Automation.Compile`
→ runtime `Reactor` graphs with reverse-order compensation, `Automation.Run` (AshStateMachine) +
`RunRecord`'s default-deny `bounded_outcomes/1` allowlist, `Automation.Health` + `Breaker`
(rate trip + operator kill-switch), `EventCapture`'s **in-transaction** `Oban.insert`, and
`Samen.Sequences` — a durable multi-step engine with a **never-nil `next_send_at` watchdog** and
row-reuse idempotency (`find_or_create_step_send/2`) that is the closest shipped precedent for
what this ADR builds.

**What is missing, stated exactly.** Grep confirms no `tools:` / `tool_use` / `tool_choice`
anywhere in `samen_core/lib`, `samen_web/lib`, or `samen_anthropic/lib`, and **no `lib/` caller
passes `history:`**. `Samen.AI.Verbs.run/3` → one `complete/4`. Search → one `embed`. The support
operator → ground → draft → E3 approval. `Samen.AI.Mcp` inverts the direction (samen is the MCP
*server*; the loop runs in the external agent's process, which is exactly why it is safe and why
it is not this gap). **The missing piece is dynamic step selection — the model choosing step
N+1 — inside samen's own process.**

**Honest sizing.** The Jido report's "~150–300 LOC" figure is right *for the step-selection core
alone* — a recursive turn function over `Samen.AI.complete/4` really is ~250 LOC. It is not the
cost of shipping this at samen's standard. Durability with crash-safe tool idempotency,
EG2-correct tool-def and tool-result scrubbing, effect-classed tool gating through E3, a
fail-honest budget, an interruptible run, two rendered surfaces with MaskingCase three-proofs, a
coverage verifier, a generator, and nine sabotage patches come to roughly **2,000–2,400 authored
non-test LOC** (§8). Stating both numbers is the point: the *novel* mechanism is small; the
*governed* mechanism is not, and the difference is why this is built rather than adopted.

**Why now, and why the requirement is now driven.** The Jido report closed with "revisit only if
a driving multi-step agent requirement is accepted in an ADR." This ADR is that acceptance. The
driving requirement is product-level: every shipped AI surface answers one question and stops. A
tenant asking "why is shipment 4471 late and who should own it?" needs the model to look, then
look again based on what it found, then propose an action — three governed steps the platform
declares it governs (EG2) and cannot currently perform.

## 2 · Decision drivers

1. **INV-7 must hold on every hop, and the hops multiply.** A single-shot call has one egress.
   An N-turn loop has N prompt egresses, N tool-definition egresses, and up to N tool-result
   re-entries — and the result of a *governed read* is exactly the shape (`%Masked{}` structs,
   `%Ash.ForbiddenField{}`, nested records) the segment allowlist refuses. Every one of those
   must be a **named scrub point**, not an assumption (§4).
2. **The registry is the allowlist, and it must narrow, never widen.** ADR-039's 8 governed
   actions already refuse non-PII-violating predicates at write time and send only through
   `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint`. A model choosing among them must not be able to reach anything
   the registry does not contain, and *within* the registry must not reach anything its own
   definition did not name.
3. **ADR-043 §6.2 is binding, not advisory.** *"AI writes do not exist … anything with side
   effects goes through the E3 approvals engine."* An agent with autonomous write tools would
   amend that ruling. This ADR does **not** amend it (§5.3), and flags the amendment as an
   operator decision (§9#1) rather than taking it silently.
4. **Durability must not weaken the same-transaction enqueue guarantee** `EventCapture` and
   `Samen.Sequences` depend on, and must not make a tool call replay a side effect.
5. **Fail-honest, always.** A budget-exhausted run must not return a truncated answer. A failed
   tool must not be summarized away. A keyless CI must be able to prove all of it (M9).
6. **Erasure must not regress.** A durable transcript is tenant data at rest. ADR-046's gate
   must stay green with **no new out-of-envelope residue and no new named residual** (§7.4).
7. **≈0-LOC vertical adoption.** The loop lives in `samen_core`/`samen_web`; a vertical's
   authored surface is a ~5-line agent module plus one router macro call. The leverage guard
   applies (CLAUDE.md).
8. **Zero new dependencies.** Reactor, AshOban, AshStateMachine, Oban, Phoenix.PubSub are
   already adopted and already carry org-scoping, plane discipline, and a policy actor. Nothing
   an agent framework offers is worth moving prompt assembly outside the AST probe's reach.

## 3 · Decision (summary)

Build **`Samen.AI.Agent`** — a first-party, durable, interruptible multi-step loop over
`Samen.AI.complete/4`, whose tools are governed `Samen.Automation.Action`s and whose every
provider-bound byte still passes `Samen.AI.Chokepoint.seal/3`. Eight load-bearing decisions:

1. **Checkpoint-per-turn, batch-per-job** (§4.1): a durable `Samen.AI.Agent.Run` row is the
   cursor; an Oban worker executes turns until a per-job turn budget, committing a checkpoint
   **between the tool decision and the tool execution**; a never-nil `next_turn_at` watchdog +
   an AshOban due-scan trigger recovers any lost job. Tool idempotency is a **turn row keyed
   `{run_id, turn_index}`**, reused on replay — the `Samen.Sequences` shape, not Oban uniqueness.
2. **Tools are a four-way narrowing intersection** (§5.1): registry ∩ **explicit per-action
   opt-in** (`tool_schema/0`, default `:not_a_tool`) ∩ the agent definition's `tools:` list ∩
   the run actor's own policy envelope. No existing action becomes a tool by accident.
   *(Five-way under the **PROPOSED** addendum §5.1a — a surface scope, T183.)*
3. **Tool definitions are EG2 egress and ride a new scrubbed `:tools` field on
   `%MaskedPayload{}`** (§4.2), scrubbed by `safe_metadata?/1`. Schemas are **static per action
   module** — never derived from tenant data — enforced structurally by the verifier.
4. **Tool results re-enter only as rendered, egress-resolved binaries through `:history`**
   (§4.3), so §3.2a applies on every subsequent turn and `safe_segment?/1` is the last line.
   Vault-routed fields render `••••` (mask-by-omission on the AI plane).
5. **Grant plaintext is categorically excluded from agent runs** (§4.4): the transcript
   persists, and INV-7 forbids grant plaintext in *any* persisted egress (§7.2). An agent run is
   masked-only even with a live grant and `grant_plaintext_egress: true`. This is a
   **clarification of ADR-043 §6.1's "ephemeral" clause, not an amendment**.
6. **Mutating tools do not execute; they propose** (§5.3): an `effect: :write` tool opens an E3
   approval through `Samen.Approvals.Gate`, the run parks in `:awaiting_approval`, and a human
   who is never the requester approves — at which point the Gate re-invokes the action **as the
   requester, `authorize?: true`** (consent, never escalation). ADR-043 §6.2 holds unamended.
7. **Fail-honest budgets and a genuine interrupt** (§6): max-turns, max-tool-calls, token, and
   wall-clock budgets; exhaustion is a terminal `:budget_exhausted` error, never a partial
   answer. `cancel/2` is durable and re-checked at every turn boundary — samen's first real
   interrupt semantics, framed honestly ("stopping after the current step").
8. **Everything is provable keyless** (§7): a deterministic `Samen.AI.Provider.Scripted`, a
   shipped-in-`lib` `Samen.AgentCase` proof kit, nine new sabotage patches, two new
   `ai_prompt_masking` structural checks, a new `samen.verify.agent_coverage` gate, an EG2 arm
   on the permanent red-team tier, and MaskingCase three-proofs on both new rendered surfaces.

## 4 · Loop architecture (design question A)

### 4.1 · Durability: where the loop lives and how a crash behaves

**Options.**

- **(a) In-process loop, Oban only at the job boundary.** `Samen.AI.Agent.run/3` recurses in the
  worker process; one job = one whole run. *Rejected.* A node restart mid-run loses every turn's
  work and, worse, loses the record that a tool already fired — so an Oban retry re-executes
  side effects with no dedupe key. It also cannot express `:awaiting_approval` (a run that must
  survive hours), and it holds a DB connection and a provider budget for the run's whole life.
- **(b) One Oban job per turn.** Each turn enqueues the next. *Rejected as the primary shape.*
  It buys crash granularity that (c) already has, at the cost of N scheduler round-trips per
  run, N job rows, and a queue-latency floor on every turn — and it does **not** solve tool
  idempotency, because the dedupe unit is still the tool call, not the job. Oban's own
  `unique:` cannot express "this tool already ran" across the pruning horizon (the exact
  reason `Automation.RunRecord` carries a tier-2 `dispatch_key` alongside RunWorker's tier-1
  uniqueness).
- **(c) Checkpoint-per-turn, batch-per-job, watchdog-recovered — RECOMMENDED.** The durable
  `Samen.AI.Agent.Run` row is the cursor (`current_turn`, `state`, `next_turn_at`, budgets
  consumed). One Oban job executes turns until a per-job turn budget (`@turns_per_job`,
  default 4) or a terminal/parked state, then either finishes or re-arms. Every turn writes
  **two** checkpoints:
  1. **the decision** — `turn_index`, chosen tool kind, validated args digest, `:proposed`;
     committed *before* any side effect;
  2. **the outcome** — status, bounded meta, rendered result, `:done`.
  A crash between (1) and (2) is recovered by the watchdog, which replays turn `N` and finds
  the existing `:proposed` turn row — the tool executes **at most once** because the executor
  reuses that row as its idempotency key (`Samen.Sequences.find_or_create_step_send/2`'s
  row-reuse pattern, verbatim in shape). Posture is stated plainly, as Sequences does:
  **at-least-once delivery, never claimed exactly-once**; the dedupe is the turn row.

**Restart semantics.** `next_turn_at` is **never `nil`** while a run is non-terminal — the
Sequences invariant, adopted because a `nil` cursor is unselectable by the due-scan `where`
clause and produces a permanent silent stall. A run in flight sets `next_turn_at = now + 600s`
(the in-flight watchdog); a parked run sets it to its approval deadline; a terminal run sets it
`nil` exactly once. An AshOban trigger `:agent_turn_due` on queue `:automation_timers` with an
**explicit `scheduler_cron("* * * * *")`** and pinned `scheduler_module_name`/`worker_module_name`
(so `mix samen.verify.oban_queues` / `Samen.Jobs.QueueParity` can see it) re-arms anything the
watchdog finds due.

**The same-transaction enqueue guarantee is preserved, not bypassed.** An agent run started from
a tenant write (the `EventCapture` path) enqueues its first job via `Oban.insert` inside the
triggering action's `after_action` — the identical idiom `Samen.Sequences`' `:advance_due` uses,
so the job exists iff the write committed. Tools that themselves enqueue (`enqueue_reminder`)
keep their own guarantee unchanged, because they run inside their own governed action's
transaction. **Slow I/O — the provider call and the tool's own egress — is deliberately outside
any transaction**, exactly as `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint.send/2` is in Sequences' worker.

**Retry authority lives in one place.** The worker returns `:ok` to Oban for every business
outcome (tool failure, provider failure, refusal, budget exhaustion); only a fetch-chain failure
returns `{:error, _}`. The run row's watchdog is the single retry authority — Sequences' rule,
adopted because two retry authorities produce compounding re-execution.

**Reactor.** `Automation.Compile` is *not* reused for the agent loop: a Reactor graph is
statically built before it runs, and the whole point here is that step N+1 is chosen after step
N returns. Reactor is still used **within** a turn: a write tool that is approved executes
through the existing `Automation.ActionStep` path so per-step compensation (`undo/3`) is
unchanged. Stated so no one later "unifies" them and loses compensation.

### 4.2 · Where tool definitions ride (EG2, half one)

A tool definition is a bounded, static map: `%{name:, description:, params: [%{name:, type:,
enum:, required?:}]}`. It cannot ride `segments` — `safe_segment?/1` refuses every map, by
design, and that refusal is exactly what sabotage 45 protects.

**Options.** (i) flatten schemas to text and prepend as segments — loses the structure real
providers need and re-introduces an ad-hoc encoding; (ii) ride `grounding[:tools]` — already
scrubbed by `safe_metadata?/1`, zero struct change, but contaminates the field whose contract is
"catalog-derived grounding metadata" and whose **parity test against `mix samen.catalog.dump`**
(§8/D9) is a shipped invariant; (iii) **add a `:tools` field to `%MaskedPayload{}`, scrubbed by
`safe_metadata?/1` — RECOMMENDED.**

(iii) wins because the chokepoint is the only minter (so adding a field costs nothing
structurally), `safe_metadata?/1` already recurses **keys and values** with `vt_` scanning and
charlist-rendering checks, the D9 grounding-parity contract stays clean, and a provider adapter
gets an unambiguous EG2 field to map onto its vendor `tools:` parameter. `seal/3` gains one more
`scrub_metadata/1` call in the same `with` chain; the `Inspect` impl renders **only the tool
count**, never names or descriptions.

**Static-schema rule (the load-bearing constraint).** A tool schema MUST be a compile-time
constant of its action module. A schema whose `enum` was populated from live records would be a
silent EG2 egress of tenant data on every turn. Dynamic choices are resolved by *calling a read
tool*, never by baking values into a definition. Enforced structurally (§7.2 check (d)).

### 4.3 · Tool-result re-entry — the exact scrub points (EG2, half two)

This is the hop the Jido report named as the one samen "does not have." Spelled out end to end;
each numbered point is an assertion site, not a description.

1. **Execution plane.** The tool runs as the run's **owner actor** — the initiating member's
   real scope, re-resolved at turn time (the `Automation.RunWorker` owner-resolution rule: a
   removed owner ⇒ `:owner_unavailable`, never silent re-attribution). Reads go through
   `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` (cross-org rows do not exist) and `Samen.Api.PiiResolution`. **The
   chokepoint never elevates, substitutes, or synthesizes an actor** (INV-2).
2. **Render (the new module: `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult.render/2`).** The action's `{:ok, meta}`
   and any records it carries are resolved through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` **in
   egress mode** (`egress: true`, `grant_egress?: false` — §4.4) and flattened to an ordered
   list of **binaries**. `%Samen.Masked{}` → `"••••"`. `%Ash.ForbiddenField{}` → `"••••"`.
   `nil` → `"••••"` (the chokepoint's own `render_value/1` semantics, reused rather than
   re-derived). Anything the renderer does not recognize is **dropped with a bounded
   `[unrenderable:<field>]` marker, never `inspect/1`-ed** — an `inspect` here would be the
   freeform-text leak `RunRecord.bounded_outcomes/1` exists to prevent.
3. **Persist.** The rendered binaries are appended to the run's transcript (§7.4) and the
   bounded turn row. Because step 2 already masked, **the transcript at rest contains no vault
   plaintext and no `vt_*` token** — a property asserted directly, not inferred.
4. **Re-enter.** On turn N+1 the transcript's rendered lines are passed as `:history` to
   `Samen.AI.complete/4`, so `Samen.AI.Chokepoint.rescrub_history/2` (§3.2a) runs over them.
   They are ordinary (untagged) segments — the agent **never** emits a `{:grant_span, …}` tag,
   because §4.4 excludes grant plaintext entirely — so they take the `other -> other` branch and
   are then `vt_`-scanned by step 5 like any segment.
5. **Refuse (the last line).** `seal/3`'s `safe_segment?/1` allowlist runs over the assembled
   payload. If the renderer ever regresses and emits a map, tuple, keyword list, struct, or atom,
   the payload **refuses `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}`** — fail-closed, payload-free. The
   renderer is defense; the allowlist is the guarantee. This is deliberate belt-and-braces: the
   sabotage in §7.1 breaks the renderer and asserts the *refusal* is what the test sees.
6. **Echo the tool call itself.** The model's own tool call (kind + args) also re-enters as
   history. It is rendered to a single `vt_`-free binary by the same renderer — **never passed
   as the raw arg map**. This is precisely the hole sabotage 45 documents: a raw `vt_*` token
   wrapped in an EG2 tool-args tuple once egressed. The new sabotage (§7.1#2) re-proves it on
   the agent path.

**Tool arguments are untrusted model output.** They are parsed, then validated by the action's
own **write-time `validate/2`** — the same validator the Workflow changeset uses — before
execution. Invalid args are a **fail-honest tool error fed back to the model as a bounded
message** (`"invalid_args: <bounded reason>"`), never a raise and never a silent coercion. An
arg referencing a subject attribute must reference a **condition-eligible** one (ADR-039 §5.2's
oracle gate), which structurally excludes vault fields from arg space.

### 4.3a · Untrusted-content sanitization at tool-result INGRESS — **ADDENDUM, STATUS: PROPOSED** (T182)

> **Status of this subsection: PROPOSED (2026-08-24, T182).** The rest of this ADR is unchanged
> and remains **ACCEPTED**. This addendum **extends** §4.3; it amends nothing and it moves no §9
> ratified decision — propose-then-approve (§9#1), masked-only runs (§9#2), the budgets (§9#3),
> the 90-day retention (§9#4), the streaming deferral (§9#5) and the verifier placement (§9#6)
> are all untouched. Source pattern: AlexClaw (Apache-2.0) + Pepe (MIT), `findings/000` +
> `findings/006` — **adapted, not translated**.

**The gap.** §4.3's six numbered points are all assertion sites, and every one of them faces
**outward**: resolve in egress mode (#2), no vault plaintext and no `vt_*` token at rest (#3),
`safe_segment?/1` refuses an unrenderable shape on the way to the provider (#5). Each protects
samen's own data from leaving. **Nothing in §4.3 protects the loop from what a tool result
brings in.** A tool result is attacker-reachable data — a tenant, or an upstream system a tenant
controls, owns the bytes in a freeform column — and step 4 re-enters those bytes into the next
turn's prompt as `:history`. Two content classes turn that data into *control*:

* **Frame forgery.** The transcript is an ordered list of plain binaries the provider reads as
  lines. A value carrying a line break does not render as one line; it renders as two, and the
  second is attacker-authored **at the start of a line**, where the loop's own frames live
  (`tool_call: `, `tool_result: `, `record: `, `hit: `).
* **Invisible content.** Zero-width and bidi format characters are read by the model and not by
  the human reviewing the transcript, so what a reviewer approved and what the model acted on
  are different strings.

**7. Neutralize (the new ingress point).** Before a binary is emitted by the renderer it passes
through `Samen.AI.Agent.Ingress.sanitize/1`, which **neutralizes** — replaces, never deletes:

  a. every codepoint in `\p{Cc}` (C0/C1 controls, `\n`/`\r`/`\t`/NEL), `\p{Cf}` (zero-width,
     BOM, soft hyphen, the bidi overrides and isolates, the interlinear marks, the U+E0000 tag
     block), `\p{Zl}` and `\p{Zp}`; and
  b. the chat-template control tokens (`<|…|>`, `[INST]`, `<<SYS>>`) and a bounded list of
     imperative frame-override phrases,

each to **one shared fixed marker**. A binary that is not valid UTF-8 is refused wholesale to a
visible marker rather than handed to a Unicode matcher.

Three properties, each an assertion site:

1. **Frame forgery is closed for `sanitize/1`'s own output, not structurally across every
   rendered line.** After (a), a value that has actually passed through `Ingress.sanitize/1`
   cannot contain a line break, so it can never open a line, so it can never forge a frame
   through that value. This is why bare role words (`user:`, `record:`) are deliberately **not**
   blocklisted — mangling ordinary tenant text buys nothing once the forgery vector is gone from
   the sanitized path. **Correction (2026-08-31, E47):** the unconditional claim as originally
   written here is false. `render_scalar/2`'s catch-all clause falls through to `unrenderable/1`
   (`samen_core/lib/samen/ai/agent/tool_result.ex:459,464-467`), whose fallback label re-echoes
   the model-supplied key **raw**, without routing it through `sanitize/1` first; a key carrying
   a line break (e.g. `{"k\ntool_result: FORGED" => %{...}}`) renders as two lines, the second an
   attacker-authored `tool_result:` frame — reproduced live at current HEAD
   (`_orch/nodes/P47/work/disproofs.md` Claim 1; sourced from `T22-verdict.json` finding V22-F1 /
   `ux-debt.yaml` UXD-10a). This path is not reachable through any of the three shipped,
   opted-in tools — their `validate/2` allowlists reject a newline-bearing argument key before it
   reaches the renderer — but that is a property of tool-input validation, not of this renderer's
   construction, and does not hold for a host action whose `validate/2` admits arbitrary keys.
2. **Not reversible.** Every neutralized span of every class collapses to the *same* marker, so
   the transform is many-to-one; a function with a collision has no inverse, and no downstream
   reader — the model included — can reconstruct the original active payload from what was
   stored. It is also idempotent, so a second pass restores nothing.
3. **Egress is byte-unchanged.** The ingress pass touches no `PiiResolution` call, no
   `%Samen.Masked{}` / `%Ash.ForbiddenField{}` / `nil` clause and no `@mask`; `Samen.AI.Chokepoint`'s
   public heads (`seal/2,3`, `complete/5,6`, `embed/4,5`) are unchanged. Sanitizing **before**
   the `vt_` sentinel scan tightens §4.3#3, but not by the mechanism originally claimed here.
   **Correction (2026-08-31, E47):** the original claim that a sentinel "obfuscated with
   zero-width characters can no longer hide behind them" is false, and backwards — reproduced
   live at current HEAD (`_orch/nodes/P47/work/disproofs.md` Claim 2; sourced from
   `T22-verdict.json` finding V22-F2 / `ux-debt.yaml` UXD-10b; the shipped test
   `samen_core/test/ai/agent_ingress_test.exs:251-252` already asserts the obfuscated value is
   *rendered*, not refused). `sentinel?/1` (`samen_core/lib/samen/ai/agent/tool_result.ex:
   441-446,469`) does a literal `String.contains?(value, "vt_")` check on both the raw and the
   sanitized text; sanitizing a `"v" <> ZWSP <> "t_…"` value inserts `[neutralized]` between "v"
   and "t_", destroying the substring in the sanitized text exactly as it was already destroyed
   in the raw text, so **neither** scan ever sees a literal `vt_` to catch. The obfuscation
   defeats the scan; sanitizing does not make the scan see it. The practical outcome is still no
   worse — the same destroyed adjacency that defeats the scan also keeps a literal `vt_` token
   out of `:history`, so nothing is disclosed to a model reading the transcript back — but that
   is a side effect of (a)'s neutralization, not the sentinel scan "seeing" what it previously
   missed. The raw value is scanned too, so the pre-T182 refusal remains a floor for an
   unobfuscated sentinel.

**Placement, and why it is not a hook.** `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult` is already the ONE site that
turns an outcome into `:history` binaries, and inside it every untrusted binary funnels through
`render_scalar/2` (values) and `render_key/1` (model-emitted argument names). Those two clauses
are the entire wiring, in both the in-process and the durable path. It is deliberately **not** a
consumer of §10a row 25's `Samen.AI.Agent.Hook` chain: that seam is an *optional, host-configured,
narrowing-only policy* seam whose `:after_tool_execution` point is handed a token-only context
that never carries the outcome's content and accepts `:halt` alone. Hosting a content rewrite
there would have to widen the one invariant the seam exists to keep, and would make a security
guarantee opt-in. A content transform inside the existing render chokepoint adds **no second
policy seam** — which is what the T181 → T184 ordering exists to protect.

**Known residual, named.** Variation selectors (U+FE00–U+FE0F, U+E0100–U+E01EF) are `Mn`/`Me`,
not `Cf`, and are left alone: they legitimately carry emoji presentation in tenant text, they
cannot forge a frame, and every codepoint they attach to still renders visibly.

**Proof.** New sabotage **289** (`sanitize/1` returns its input verbatim) flips the two named
ingress reds in `samen_core/test/ai/agent_ingress_test.exs`, one per payload class, each with its
positive control. Shipped sabotage **255** is regenerated against the new clause with the same
defect and the same two `MUST_FAIL` targets.

### 4.3b · Secrets-redaction lane, distinct from `pii_*` — **ADDENDUM, STATUS: PROPOSED** (T184)

> **Status of this subsection: PROPOSED (2026-08-26, T184).** The rest of this ADR is unchanged
> and remains **ACCEPTED**. This addendum **extends** §4.3a; it amends nothing and moves no §9
> ratified decision. Source pattern: Condukt (MIT library) — **adapted, not translated**.

**The gap.** `pii_*` (`Samen.Pii.Info`, the vault, `PiiResolution.resolve/4`) governs content a
resource **declares**: a column marked `pii_attribute(:ssn, ..., vault: :pii_ssn)` resolves
through the vault on every read. It has no opinion about a column nobody declared — a tenant's
freeform note that happens to contain an operator's leaked AWS key, or an app config value
copied into a support-ticket body. Those bytes carry no vault token and nothing `PiiResolution`
can key on: they are free text that merely happens to be secret-**shaped**. Repo evidence: zero
hits for secret-pattern/free-text-scanner terms anywhere in `samen_core`/`samen_web`, no Logger
`filter_parameters`; the two adjacent shipped facts are both narrower — `:pii_secret`
(`gen/post_templates.ex`) is a declared-attribute generator example never wired into
`no_plaintext_pii.ex`, and `redact_payload/1` (mailbox/delivery/enrichment/billing provider
behaviours) is a fixed-key `Map.drop` over inbound webhook envelopes that never runs on the AI
plane.

**8. Redact (a second, distinct ingress pass).** At the SAME two clauses §4.3a already owns —
`render_scalar/2` (values) and `render_key/1` (model-emitted argument names) in
`Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult` — `Samen.AI.Agent.Secrets.redact/1` runs **first**, on the untouched
raw binary, before `Ingress.sanitize/1`: a pattern scan for two ordered classes, both collapsing
to ONE fixed marker distinct from `Ingress.marker/0`:

  a. **known vendor-shaped prefixes** (AWS access/session key ids, GitHub tokens classic and
     fine-grained, Slack tokens, Stripe live/restricted keys, npm tokens, Google API keys, PEM
     private-key headers, JWTs, `Authorization: Bearer` values, and connection-string schemes
     carrying an embedded `user:pass@host` credential); and
  b. **a fail-closed generic fallback** — an `api_key=`/`token=`/`secret=`/`password=`-shaped
     label assigned a non-trivial value, regardless of whether the value matches any known
     vendor format. This is the "unrecognized-but-secret-shaped string is redacted, not passed
     through" floor.

Three properties, mirroring §4.3a's:

1. **A distinct lane, not a wider `pii_*`.** This module never calls `PiiResolution.resolve/4`,
   never reads `Samen.Pii.Info`, and is not invoked from `render_field/2` or the record-resolution
   path — those remain byte-unchanged. A secret with no `pii_*` declaration is still caught
   because the vector is a pattern match, not a vault lookup; a `pii_*` field with no secret
   shape is still vault-masked because that machinery is untouched.
2. **Not reversible.** Every redacted span of both classes collapses to the same fixed marker —
   a collision, hence no inverse — and the marker itself matches neither class, so a second pass
   changes nothing.
3. **Ordering is load-bearing.** `redact/1` runs BEFORE `Ingress.sanitize/1` on the raw binary so
   a control/bidi character `Ingress` would later collapse cannot first split a label/value
   adjacency the generic fallback depends on. A known vendor-shaped secret cannot be evaded this
   way either — its signature is internal to the token, not a separate label.

**Placement, and why it is not a hook.** Same reasoning as §4.3a, restated for a third content
transform at the identical two clauses: `:after_tool_execution` is optional, host-configured,
narrowing-only, and its context never carries outcome content, so hosting a redaction pass there
would make a security guarantee opt-in. No new dispatch point; no `Chokepoint` public head
touched. Two policy seams in one loop is the failure the T181 → T184 ordering exists to prevent
— this is the THIRD content transform inside the one existing render chokepoint, not a fourth
seam.

**Known residual, named.** The generic labeled fallback requires label/separator/value adjacency
in the raw string; an attacker who interleaves zero-width/bidi noise between an *unrecognized*
secret's label and its value could defeat pattern (b) specifically (pattern (a)'s vendor
signatures do not depend on a label at all, so they are unaffected). This is the honest trade
against the fallback silently over-redacting ordinary tenant text containing words like
"password" near unrelated content.

**Proof.** New sabotage **291** (`redact/1` returns its input verbatim) flips the two named
secrets reds in `samen_core/test/ai/agent_ingress_test.exs` (one known-vendor, one unrecognized
generic), each with its positive control, plus the unit floor in
`samen_core/test/samen/ai/agent/secrets_test.exs`. Shipped sabotage **255** is regenerated a
second time against the rewritten `render_scalar/2` clause, same defect, same two `MUST_FAIL`
targets.

### 4.4 · Grant plaintext is categorically excluded from agent runs

ADR-043 §6.1 admits grant-covered plaintext into **ephemeral completion payloads only**, and
§7.2 is categorical that grants never apply to persisted egress. An agent run's history **is
persisted** — that is what makes it resumable. Therefore:

> **An agent run resolves masked on every plane, regardless of any live reveal grant and
> regardless of `grant_plaintext_egress`.** `Samen.AI.Agent` passes `grant_egress?: false`
> explicitly at every `complete/4` call; the transcript can never contain a `{:grant_span, …}`
> tag; §3.2a's re-mask path is therefore vacuous *for agent runs by construction*, not by luck.

This is a **clarification** of §6.1's "ephemeral" clause applied to a new persisted surface, not
an amendment: nothing in §6.1 is weakened, and the one permitted exception is unchanged for
single-shot completions. It is nonetheless product-visible (an agent answers about PII-bearing
fields shape-only, always), so it is carried as **operator decision §9#2** with the
recommendation to take it.

The alternative — hold history in memory for one job batch and admit grant plaintext within it —
was considered and rejected: it makes a run's masking depend on whether it happened to be
resumed, which is the worst possible property for an invariant to have.

---

## 5 · The tool surface (design question B)

### 5.1 · Tools are governed Automation.Actions, and the intersection narrows four ways

```
callable_tools(agent, actor) =
      Samen.Automation.Action.registry()          # 1. the governed allowlist (ADR-039)
    ∩ {a | a.tool_schema() != :not_a_tool}        # 2. explicit per-action opt-in, default OFF
    ∩ agent.definition.tools                      # 3. the agent's own declared list
    ∩ {a | authorized?(a, actor)}                 # 4. the run actor's real policy envelope
```

Two optional callbacks are added to `Samen.Automation.Action`, both **fail-closed by default**,
so **no shipped action becomes a tool without an explicit edit**:

```elixir
@callback tool_schema() :: map() | :not_a_tool   # default :not_a_tool  — not a tool
@callback effect()      :: :read | :write        # default :write       — approval-gated
@optional_callbacks tool_schema: 0, effect: 0
```

`effect/0` defaulting to `:write` matters: an action that forgets to declare falls under the
approval gate rather than executing autonomously. The 8 shipped kinds are all side-effecting
(`notify`, `send_email`, `mutate_record`, `assign_owner`, `add_tag`, `escalate`, `webhook`,
`enqueue_reminder`), so an agent with only the current registry could look but never *see*.
Batch **A3** therefore adds two **read-effect** actions to the same registry —
`"search_records"` (org-scoped tsvector + semantic search through the shipped
`Samen.AI.Embeddings.search/3`) and `"fetch_record"` (a governed single-record read projected to
catalog-declared, condition-eligible fields) — rather than inventing a second read-tool registry.
**One registry stays the one allowlist**; that is the whole reason the registry is trustworthy.

**Excluded by rule, named so no one adds them later:** `Samen.AI.Analytics.ask/4` is not a tool.
T144 would refuse it for any tenant actor anyway (`platform_actor?/1`, impersonation refused
first), and offering a tool that always fails is a dead end, not honesty. `webhook` is not
opt-in-eligible in v1 (arbitrary model-chosen egress to a model-chosen URL is a new egress class
this ADR does not govern). Neither exclusion is enforced by taste: both are structural verifier
lines (§7.2 check (e)).

**Recursion guard.** An agent run carries `depth` and `chain` (the `Automation.Context` idiom).
An agent tool may not start another agent run at `depth > 0` in v1; the attempt is a bounded
`:depth_exceeded` tool error. This reuses the shipped loop-provenance fields rather than a new
mechanism.

**Context construction.** Tools receive a `%Samen.Automation.Context{}` — but its
`@enforce_keys` include `:workflow_id`, and an agent run is not a workflow. Rather than stuff a
run id into a field that means something else (a lie the Health surface would then render), the
struct gains one **optional, additive** field `:origin` (`{:workflow, id} | {:agent, run_id}`),
exactly as T40 added four optional fields without breaking any `%Context{}` match, and
`workflow_id` becomes nil-able **only** when `origin` is `{:agent, _}`. A single builder,
`Samen.AI.Agent.Context.build/2`, is the only site that constructs an agent-origin context.

### 5.1a · Surface-scoped tool registries — **ADDENDUM, STATUS: PROPOSED** (T183)

> **Status of this subsection: PROPOSED (2026-08-25, T183).** The rest of this ADR is unchanged
> and remains **ACCEPTED**. This addendum **extends** §5.1 by adding a fifth *narrowing* arm; it
> amends nothing, widens nothing, and moves no §9 ratified decision — propose-then-approve
> (§9#1), masked-only runs (§9#2), the budgets (§9#3), the 90-day retention (§9#4), the
> streaming deferral (§9#5) and the verifier placement (§9#6) are all untouched. §3 item 2 and
> §5.1 say "four-way"; with this addendum the intersection narrows **five** ways. Source
> pattern: Condukt (MIT library), `findings/038` — **adapted, not translated**.

**The gap.** §5.1's intersection and ADR-043 §9's MCP server describe two tool sets that never
meet, and the code matched: `Samen.Automation.Action.registry/0` and `Samen.AI.Mcp`'s hardcoded
four-name set were two hand-rolled registries with no shared abstraction and **no way to express
a surface at all**. So the only answer either could give about the other's tools was
`{:error, {:unknown_tool, name}}` — *merely absent*, indistinguishable from a typo, and a
posture that gets weaker with every surface added (the operator plane, a CI eval lane).

**The decision.** One abstraction, `Samen.AI.ToolSurface`, owns a **closed set of four
surfaces** — `:mcp` (ADR-043 §9's external window), `:operator` (ADR-047 §7.3's plane, which
owns no tools **by current declaration** — see the correction below, not "by construction" as
originally written), `:tenant` (this ADR's loop, as the run owner) and `:ci_eval` (the ADR-043
§10 / D8 keyless eval lane) — each owning **its own registry**, and both prior paths resolve
through it. Cross-surface invocation is refused **by name**:
`{:error, {:tool_off_surface, name, surface}}` on the MCP face, and the bounded new
`@error_kind` `:tool_off_surface` in the loop, at definition resolution *and* per call.

**Correction (2026-08-31, E47):** "which owns no tools by construction" as originally written
here is false. Reproduced live at current HEAD (`_orch/nodes/P47/work/disproofs.md`, the §5.1a
claim; sourced from `T23-verdict.json`'s operator-plane declarability probe / `ux-debt.yaml`
UXD-13): `:operator` sits in `Samen.AI.ToolSurface`'s own `@action_surfaces` list
(`samen_core/lib/samen/ai/tool_surface.ex:71`: `[:tenant, :ci_eval, :operator]`) alongside
`:tenant` and `:ci_eval` — it is declarable from a host action exactly like the other two. A
host action declaring `tool_surfaces/0 -> [:operator]`, combined with host config
`agent_surface: :operator`, makes `Samen.AI.Agent.Tools.resolve_definition/1` — the exact
function the loop calls — return a real, callable tool entry on the operator surface. The
registry is empty **today** because no shipped action currently declares `:operator` and the
default `agent_surface/0` is `:tenant`, not because the abstraction structurally forbids
population. Both deliberate host acts route through the same documented seam
(`Samen.Automation.Action`'s `extra` config, `samen_core/lib/samen/automation/action.ex:138`),
at the same trust level as any other host-authored tool, and widen nothing already open on the
other three surfaces.

**Why it is not a hook.** T181's chain (§10a row 25) is optional, host-configured and
narrowing-only; a surface scope is a *structural property of which registry owns the tool*, so
hosting it there would make a by-construction guarantee opt-in — the inversion
`Samen.Files.ChokepointGuard` exists to prevent. It is also strictly upstream of
`:before_tool_call`, which fires only *after* the intersection.

**Properties.** (a) Membership is declared by the tool, never by a third hardcoded list: the
`:mcp` registry is read from `Samen.AI.Mcp.tool_names/0`, and the action registries from each
action's own optional `tool_surfaces/0` — the same explicit per-module opt-in shape as
`tool_schema/0` and `effect/0`. (b) `:mcp` is **not declarable from an action**: MCP tools and
governed Automation actions have different execution contracts, and `resolve/2` must never admit
a name `Samen.AI.Mcp` cannot dispatch. (c) An action declaring nothing is on `[:tenant]` only —
the lane it already ran on, so the upgrade widens nothing while `:ci_eval` and `:mcp` stay
opt-in; a **malformed** declaration (unloadable, raising, non-list, or naming one member outside
the action-declarable set) is refused **whole** and lands the action on no surface at all.
(d) `:ci_eval` carries the read tools only — an admitted `effect: :write` call opens a REAL E3
approval, which a deterministic CI lane must be structurally incapable of causing. (e) The
surface is **host application config** (`Samen.AI.ToolSurface.agent_surface/0`), identical in
`run/4` and in the durable worker, never a per-run opt and **never derived from the actor** — a
surface is a deployment lane, not an identity. A misconfigured value owns no registry, so a typo
disables every tool rather than falling back to a wider one.

### 5.2 · What reaches the LLM, and what does not

| EG2 artifact | route | scrub |
|---|---|---|
| tool **definitions** | `%MaskedPayload{tools: [...]}` (§4.2) | `safe_metadata?/1` — keys **and** values recursed, `vt_` scanned, charlist rendering scanned, structs refused |
| tool **call** the model emitted (kind + args), echoed next turn | `:history` binary via `ToolResult.render/2` | `safe_segment?/1` after §3.2a |
| tool **result** | `:history` binaries via `ToolResult.render/2`, after `PiiResolution` egress-mode resolution | `safe_segment?/1` after §3.2a |
| prior **assistant** text | `:history` binary | `safe_segment?/1` after §3.2a |
| the **goal** prompt | the versioned `Samen.AI.Prompt` resource (PII-scanned at write; may not contain `vt_`) | unchanged (EG1) |
| catalog **grounding** | `:grounding`, unchanged | `safe_metadata?/1`, D9 parity test unchanged |

Native provider tool-calling is supported without touching the `Samen.AI.Provider` behaviour:
`%Samen.AI.Completion{}` gains an **optional `:tool_calls` field (default `[]`)** — the struct's
field list was explicitly deferred to T64 in ADR-043 §11, so this is in-contract. An adapter that
supports native tool use maps the vendor response into that bounded field; an adapter that does
not leaves it empty and the agent falls back to parsing a bounded JSON envelope out of
`Completion.text` (the Prompt resource instructs the format). `tool_calls` is provider
**ingress**, so INV-7 does not govern its arrival — but its contents are untrusted model output
that becomes EG2 egress on the next turn's echo, which is why §4.3#6 exists.

### 5.3 · Mutating tools do not execute — they propose

ADR-043 §6.2 rules that AI outputs are drafts and proposals and that anything with side effects
goes through E3. This ADR **honors it unamended**:

- an `effect: :read` tool executes inline in the turn;
- an `effect: :write` tool **opens an approval** via `Samen.Approvals.Gate` —
  `kind_for(resource, action)`, `subject_ref = "samen:<abbrev>:<id>"`, `requested_by` = the
  **AI service principal** already shipped for the support operator (§6.3), which is a real,
  auditable identity that holds no reveal grants and is **denied the approve action by policy**;
- the run transitions to `:awaiting_approval` with a deadline and a non-nil `next_turn_at`;
- a human — never the requester, enforced at both the policy and `<abbrev>_distinct_party`
  DB-CHECK layers — approves, and `Gate.on_approve/2` re-invokes the action **as the requester,
  `authorize?: true`, inside the decision transaction**. Approval adds second-party consent,
  never privilege escalation. A handler error rolls the whole decision back: the approval stays
  `pending`, nothing executed;
- the approval handler resumes the run by clearing `next_turn_at` to `now` and enqueuing the
  next turn — inside that same transaction (the `EventCapture` idiom), so a resumed run exists
  iff the approval committed;
- rejection terminates the run `:rejected` with the honest outcome surfaced to the tenant.

Red path (the RP-AI-6 analog, and the batch A4 gate): **no path from an agent turn to a mutating
governed action without an approve event**, with the approve-then-execute positive control.

---

## 6 · Safety rails (design question C)

**Budgets — four, all fail-honest.** Per run: `max_turns` (default 8), `max_tool_calls`
(default 12), `max_input_tokens` / `max_output_tokens` (default 60k / 8k, summed from
`Completion.usage`), and `deadline_seconds` (default 600). Exhaustion of any budget is a
**terminal state `:budget_exhausted` with a bounded `error_kind`**, and the run's result is
`{:error, :budget_exhausted}`.

> **Never a partial answer.** The last assistant turn is **not** promoted to a result. The UI
> says "Stopped at the turn/token budget — this is not a partial answer." This is the ADR-014
> fail-honest contract applied to a new surface: a run that did not finish must not return a
> value that looks like it did. Sabotage §7.1#4 exists precisely to keep this refutable.

**Circuit breakers — two, both reusing shipped shapes.**
- *Rate trip*: the `Samen.Automation.Breaker` shape — count agent runs per org (and per agent
  definition) in a fixed window from the run log itself (no second counter), and past the
  configured threshold trip the **same operator kill action a human uses**, with reason
  `:rate_tripped`, idempotently, audited. Only ever trips; re-arming is explicit-operator-only.
- *Provider trip*: consecutive normalized provider errors past a threshold park the agent
  definition rather than burning budget across every tenant during an outage. Fail-honest: the
  run's error is `{:provider_error, provider}` (already content-free), never a fabricated answer.

**Kill-switch is re-checked at every turn, not at run start.** A run is long-lived; the
`Automation.RunWorker` "already-queued half" lesson (a run of a paused workflow finalizes
`:skipped`, never fires) generalizes: an operator kill or a tenant cancel between turn 3 and
turn 4 must stop turn 4. Sabotage §7.1#7 asserts it.

**Audit + turn log — token-only, matching the E4 pattern.** Per turn the run records exactly:
`turn_index`, `tool_kind`, **arg key names only** (never values), `status`, `error_kind` (closed
enum), `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `duration_ms`, `provider`, `simulated?`. This is
`RunRecord.bounded_outcomes/1`'s default-deny allowlist reused verbatim — `plain_map?/1` refuses
anything struct-shaped, so a Reactor error or an Exception can never be `inspect`ed into the log,
and `safe_error_kind/1` degrades an unknown kind rather than rejecting the finalize. The
`AuditEvent` line per run is likewise token-only: run id, agent name, turn count, terminal state,
token totals. **No prompt text, no tool arg values, no result text, ever.**

---

## 7 · Proof obligations (design question F)

### 7.1 · New sabotage patches (nine)

Each is a `scripts/sabotages/*.patch` with the house header (`SABOTAGE:` / `APP:` /
`TEST_FILES:` / `MUST_FAIL:`), applied → the named tests must FAIL → reverted → SHA-256
byte-exact. Listed with the invariant each keeps refutable.

| # | Sabotage | Named test must fail |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | tool-def scrub bypass — `seal/3` copies `:tools` into the payload without `scrub_metadata/1` | *a `vt_`/canary-bearing tool definition is REFUSED fail-closed* |
| 2 | tool-result raw re-entry — `ToolResult.render/2` returns the raw record/arg map instead of rendered binaries | *a raw tool result/arg map is REFUSED at the chokepoint (`:pii_egress_refused`)* |
| 3 | egress-mode drop — the renderer resolves without `egress: true` | *tool results re-enter MASKED (`••••`), never plaintext* |
| 4 | budget dishonesty — exhaustion promotes the last assistant turn to `{:ok, …}` | *budget exhaustion is fail-honest, never a partial answer* |
| 5 | allowlist escape — the tool resolver calls `Action.module_for/1` directly, skipping the four-way intersection | *an agent cannot call a tool outside its own definition / not opted in* |
| 6 | write-without-approval — an `effect: :write` tool executes inline | *no path from an agent turn to a mutating action without an approve event* |
| 7 | kill/cancel checked once — re-check moved from per-turn to run start | *a cancelled (or operator-killed) run executes no further turn* |
| 8 | turn-row idempotency removed — the executor creates a new turn row on replay | *a replayed turn does not re-execute its tool* |
| 9 | transcript masking twin — the agent LiveView renders the unresolved value | the MaskingCase red assertion (`assert_masked_dom!/2`) on the agent transcript surface |

Patch 2 is the direct descendant of the shipped `45-t65-ai-egress-scrub-shape-blind-tuple-hole`
(the EG2 tool-args tuple hole) and patch 3 of `44-d2-ai-egress-history-remask-bypass` (the
multi-turn re-scrub) — both existing patches are re-read at A3 to make sure the agent path does
not route around what they protect.

### 7.2 · Verifier additions

**`mix samen.verify.ai_prompt_masking` gains two structural checks** (it is the INV-7 gate; these
are INV-7 facts):

- **(d) tool-schema boundedness + staticness.** Every module exporting `tool_schema/0` returns a
  map whose leaves are binaries/atoms/numbers/booleans/lists/maps, contains no `vt_`, and is
  **compile-time constant** (no call into `Ash.read`, `Repo`, `Application.get_env`, or any
  function of tenant data — an AST check on the function body, the anti-bypass probe's technique).
- **(e) tool eligibility.** Every module exporting `tool_schema/0` also exports `effect/0`; every
  `effect: :write` tool is reachable only through `Samen.Approvals.Gate`; `"webhook"` and any
  analytics action are **not** opt-in eligible; every `Samen.AI.Agent` definition's `tools:` list
  is a subset of the opted-in registry.

**New: `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage`** (house shape — `run/1` →
`Samen.Verifier.halt_if_violations/2`, `violations/1` callable without halting; wired into
`ci.sh`, the `ci_sh.eex` template step list, and the generated-app gate). It asserts:

1. every registered agent module ships the mandated `AgentCase` red-path test files (the G26
   generator discipline, applied to agents);
2. every opted-in tool declares both callbacks and carries a per-tool test;
3. the agent-run resource carries a retention `:shred` spec (§7.4) — erasure reach is a coverage
   fact, not a hope;
4. **non-vacuity floor:** discovery must find ≥1 agent and ≥1 opted-in tool, else FAIL. The
   ADR-046 E7 lesson — *a gate that discovers nothing verifies nothing* — applied here.

*Placement note (operator decision §9#6):* checks 1–3 could have been folded into
`ai_prompt_masking`. Recommendation is a separate task, because `ai_prompt_masking` means "INV-7
holds structurally" and diluting it with DX-coverage assertions makes a failure of that gate
ambiguous — the thing a security gate must never be.

### 7.3 · Red-team + MaskingCase

**The permanent red-team tier (ADR-043 §10.2) gains an EG2 arm** in
`samen_core/test/ai_eval/ai_plane_redteam_test.exs`: a `describe "EG2 — tool definitions, tool
args, tool results"` block with, at minimum — a canary-seeded record fetched by `fetch_record`
and asserted `••••` in `Provider.Fake.sent_payloads/0`; a tool definition carrying a canary in a
description; a model-emitted tool arg carrying a `vt_*` token; a **multi-turn agent run under an
expired grant** (the §3.2a case, now on the agent path); a budget-exhaustion run asserted honest
under `CaptureLog` + attached telemetry (EG6); and an allowlist-escape attempt. Pass remains zero
canary plaintext and zero `vt_*` in **any** recorded payload, vector row, transcript row, log
line, telemetry event, or rendered error.

**MaskingCase three-proofs** ship for both new rendered surfaces (the tenant agent transcript
LiveView and the operator agent-health LiveView): tenant plane clear, operator-without-grant
`••••` with no `vt_*` in DOM/CSV/API, sabotage twin proving the assertion refutable
(`assert_leak_detected!/2`). The operator surface additionally asserts the **transcript is not
rendered at all** on the operator plane (§8/A5) — mask-by-omission, not mask-by-styling.

### 7.4 · Erasure — how agent transcripts and checkpoints are reached

An agent run holds three kinds of tenant data at rest:

1. **the goal / user free text** — tenant keystrokes, which the platform's own §3.2-step-2(d)
   rule treats as consented but which may still contain PII;
2. **the rendered transcript** — masked by construction (§4.3#3), so it carries no vault
   plaintext and no `vt_*`; but it may echo (1);
3. **the bounded turn log** — ids, enums, counts. No PII by allowlist.

**Decision:** (1) and (2) are stored in a **vault-routed attribute** on the agent-run resource —
`pii do vault(:pii_transcript); pii_attribute(:transcript, :string, vault: :pii_transcript);
reveal(:reveal_agent_run) end` — so they live **inside the DEK envelope**, keyed on the run row's
own id (the framework's per-row crypto-shred unit, `Samen.Vault.Change.resolve_subject_id/1`).
(3) stays a plain bounded jsonb column, like `Automation.Run.outcome`.

Consequences, stated honestly:

- **No new out-of-envelope residue.** `mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness`'s three discovery
  classes (derived-linkable `_bidx` columns, `pii_declared` bags, `storage_key` blobs) gain **no
  new member**, and no new named residual appears. A1/A2's gate obligation is to run that
  verifier before and after and show the residual list byte-identical.
- **Subject-level reach is by retention, exactly as for `Automation.Reminder`'s vaulted note.**
  A run's DEK is keyed on the run, not on the person the run discussed — the same posture every
  shipped domain row with a vaulted free-text field has. A **default retention `:shred` spec on
  the agent-run resource** (90 days, §9#4) is therefore shipped in A2 and wired into
  `default_specs` so `mix samen.gen.app` is complete by construction, closing the window rather
  than leaving it open indefinitely.
- **The "about-a-subject" boundary is the same one ADR-046 §7#5 names**, not a new one: free text
  a tenant typed *about* a third party is reached by the run's own retention shred, not by that
  third party's erasure. Recorded as a **carried-forward residual with an explicit pointer to
  ADR-046 §7#5**, so the two are ruled on together rather than drifting apart.

## 8 · Build plan — the BATON batch sequence

Ordered fix→verify batches, house shape: one deliverable per agent, fan-out concurrency 1,
**gate tasks run in the foreground (synchronous blocking Bash, never backgrounded-and-awaited)**.
Each batch ends with: its sabotages flip the named tests and revert byte-exact; suites +
`./ci.sh` green before and after; a phase commit in `git log --oneline -5` house style.
**Schema** = reserves abbrevs via `mix samen.abbrev.reserve` (driven by the generator — the
registry is never hand-edited), regenerates `schema.dict` via the sanctioned task, and runs the
FULL root gate. **Masking** = ships MaskingCase three-proofs.

| # | Batch | Scope | Schema? | Masking? | Sabotages / test obligations |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A1** | **The loop core, keyless, tool-free** | `Samen.AI.Agent` behaviour + `use` macro + validated `definition/0`; `Samen.AI.Agent.Run` resource (AshStateMachine: `queued → running → {succeeded, failed, cancelled, budget_exhausted}`) + turn rows; `Samen.AI.Provider.Scripted` (deterministic scripted turns, `simulated?/0 == true`, `%MaskedPayload{}` head-match); `Samen.AgentCase` in `samen_core/lib`; `:history` threading through `complete/4`; budgets; `cancel/2` | **yes** (2 resources + abbrevs) | no | S4 (budget honesty), S7 (cancel per-turn); tests: N-turn history accumulates and re-scrubs; max-turns terminates; **anti-vacuity** — every red assertion paired with a positive control |
| **A2** | **Durability, idempotency, breakers, erasure** | Oban worker + AshOban `:agent_turn_due` trigger (explicit `scheduler_cron`, pinned module names); never-nil `next_turn_at` watchdog; `{run_id, turn_index}` turn-row reuse; same-transaction launch enqueue; `Breaker`-shaped rate trip + provider trip; operator kill-switch; bounded turn log (`bounded_outcomes/1` reuse); **vault-routed transcript + default retention `:shred` spec** | **yes** (transcript vault route) | no | S8 (replayed turn double-executes); tests: crash-between-decision-and-execution replays without re-firing; nil-watchdog stall detected; `mix samen.verify.oban_queues` green; **`mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness` residual list byte-identical before/after** |
| **A3** | **The tool surface — read tools + EG2 scrubbing** | `tool_schema/0` + `effect/0` optional callbacks (defaults `:not_a_tool` / `:write`); two read actions (`search_records`, `fetch_record`) opted in; `%MaskedPayload{}` `:tools` field + `scrub_metadata` call + Inspect count-only; `%Completion{}` `:tool_calls` field; `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult.render/2`; arg parse → `validate/2` gate; four-way intersection resolver; `Automation.Context` `:origin` field + `Agent.Context.build/2` | no | **yes** (tool-result masking three-proof) | S1 (tool-def scrub bypass), S2 (raw re-entry), S3 (egress-mode drop), S5 (allowlist escape); re-read shipped sabotages 44 + 45 and confirm the agent path does not route around them |
| **A4** | **The write surface — propose-then-approve** | `effect: :write` routes to `Samen.Approvals.Gate`; run parks `:awaiting_approval` with deadline; approval handler resumes in-transaction; rejection terminates honestly; AI service principal reused as requester and denied approve by policy; depth/chain recursion guard | no | no | S6 (write-without-approval); **RP-AI-6 analog**: no path from an agent turn to a mutating action without an approve event, with the approve-then-execute positive control; requester ≠ approver proven at both layers |
| **A5** | **The surfaces — tenant + operator** | `Samen.Web.AI.AgentLive` (per-turn progress, transcript, approve/reject cards, cancel button); `Samen.Web.Operator.AgentHealthLive` (bounded turn log, kill/rearm — the `AutomationHealthLive` mirror); id-only PubSub envelopes + per-viewer re-read (the Chat/Notifications precedent); clause-per-outcome renderer extending `Samen.Web.AI.Components.ai_result/1` | no | **yes** (three-proof on both surfaces) | S9 (transcript masking twin); tests: operator plane renders **no transcript at all**; `:not_configured` renders `Samen.AI.configuration_hint/0` verbatim; `:budget_exhausted` renders the honest copy; SIMULATED badge driven by `Completion.simulated`, never parsed from text |
| **A6** | **The v1 vertical slice — driftwood support triage, ≈0-LOC** | `samen_agent_routes` router macro; a ~5-line `Driftwood.Support.TriageAgent`; also mounts `samen_ai_routes` (today **no vertical mounts it** — the AI kit has a seam with no adoption proof; close that gap here); dogfood evidence recorded | no | no | leverage guard: authored vertical LOC ≤ ~10; end-to-end proof — multi-turn + read tool + masked person fields + a write proposal + approval + budget, all keyless under `Provider.Scripted` |
| **A7** | **The gates** | `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` (+ non-vacuity floor); `ai_prompt_masking` checks (d) + (e); the EG2 `describe` arm on the permanent red-team tier; `mix samen.gen.agent` + its templates + a `gen_agent_probe.exs` wrapped by `ci.sh`'s `run_gen_probe` (byte-exact abbrev-registry restore, SIGINT-safe) | no | no | **Lands LAST** — it asserts what A1–A6 built. Sabotage: remove any one coverage assertion → the named gate test flips. Verifier tests drive the true exit code via `System.cmd/3` (house discipline) |

**Rationale for the order.** A1 proves the loop is real and honest before anything can fire a
side effect. A2 makes it survive a restart *before* tools exist, so idempotency is designed
rather than retrofitted. A3 opens the EG2 surface with **read-only** tools, so the first
tool-shaped egress carries no write risk. A4 adds writes only once the approval seam is the only
door. A5 is UX on a mechanism that is already correct. A6 proves ≈0-LOC adoption end to end.
A7 lands last, ADR-046 E7's shape, because a coverage gate that runs before the thing it covers
exists can only be vacuous.

**Estimated authored scope (non-test).** A1 ≈ 500 · A2 ≈ 350 · A3 ≈ 400 · A4 ≈ 200 · A5 ≈ 450 ·
A6 ≈ 100 (of which ~10 in driftwood) · A7 ≈ 450. **≈ 2,450 LOC core**, plus roughly the same
again in tests, plus 9 sabotage patches. The dynamic-step-selection core the Jido report sized at
150–300 LOC is real and is inside A1 — the rest is durability, EG2 governance, proof, and
honesty, which is the part that cannot be bought from a dependency.

## 9 · Decisions for the operator

All seven were **ratified by the operator on 2026-08-14, each exactly as recommended**, and are
marked **TAKEN** below (the ADR-046 §7 convention). The ratification unblocked A1; with **A7
landed the ADR is now ACCEPTED (2026-08-17)** — every §9 decision is ratified-and-shipped, and
every §10a deviation is resolved or carried as a named residual (rows 22–24).

| # | Decision | Options | Recommendation | Taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | **Autonomous writes.** May an agent execute a mutating tool without a human approve? This would **amend ADR-043 §6.2** ("AI writes do not exist … anything with side effects goes through E3"). | (a) **propose-then-approve for every mutating tool** (§6.2 unamended) · (b) autonomous-with-audit for a bounded low-risk subset (e.g. `add_tag`) behind a per-agent `autonomous_writes:` opt-in · (c) fully autonomous with audit | **(a).** ADR-043 §6.2 is a shipped ruling with a DB-CHECK behind it; an agent is exactly the actor it was written for. (b) is a coherent v2 once A1–A7 have a green red-team and real usage data, and the design leaves room for it (`effect/0` already classes the tools); taking it now would mean the first autonomous AI write in the platform ships in the same batch as the loop that decides it. | **TAKEN — (a)**: every mutating tool is propose-then-approve; ADR-043 §6.2 holds **unamended** (binds A4). |
| **2** | **Grant plaintext in agent runs.** May a live reveal grant + `grant_plaintext_egress: true` admit plaintext into an agent run? | (a) **never — agent runs are masked-only** · (b) admit it, and persist the transcript with the `{:grant_span, …}` tag · (c) admit it only for runs that never persist (in-memory batch) | **(a).** The transcript persists, and INV-7 §7.2 is categorical that grants never apply to persisted egress. (b) puts grant plaintext at rest, contradicting §7.2. (c) makes masking depend on whether a run happened to be resumed — the worst property an invariant can have. **Product cost, named:** an agent answers about PII-bearing fields shape-only, always. | **TAKEN — (a)**: never — agent runs are masked-only on every plane, `grant_egress?: false` at every `complete/4` call (§4.4; binds A1+). |
| **3** | **Default budgets / cost posture.** | as proposed · tighter · looser · per-org overrides only | **PROPOSED defaults:** `max_turns 8`, `max_tool_calls 12`, `max_input_tokens 60_000`, `max_output_tokens 8_000`, `deadline_seconds 600`, rate trip 60 runs/org/hour. All host-configurable. The **floor** — exhaustion is fail-honest and never a partial answer — is not configurable and is not an operator decision. | **TAKEN — as proposed**: `max_turns 8` / `max_tool_calls 12` / `max_input_tokens 60_000` / `max_output_tokens 8_000` / `deadline_seconds 600` / rate trip 60 runs/org/hour, all host-configurable; the fail-honest floor is **non-configurable** (binds A1's budget engine, A2's breaker). |
| **4** | **Transcript retention window.** How long does a vault-routed agent transcript live before the default `:shred` retention spec destroys its DEK? | 30 · **90** · 365 days · never (keep until account erasure) | **90 days.** Long enough for support and dispute review, short enough that a run's echoed free text is not an indefinite liability. Shipped as a `default_specs` entry so `mix samen.gen.app` is complete by construction; hosts may lengthen or shorten. | **TAKEN — 90 days**, in the DEK envelope, shipped as a `default_specs` `:shred` entry (binds A2). |
| **5** | **Token streaming.** Should turns stream provider deltas to the LiveView? | ship in v1 · **defer to v2, named** | **Defer, named.** Streaming is a *second* provider egress surface with its own EG6 shadow: partial deltas would bypass `seal/3`'s whole-payload scrub unless the chokepoint grows a streaming contract, which is a separate ADR. v1 reports **turn-level progress**, which is the honest and useful 80%. Recorded as a residual, not silently dropped. | **TAKEN — deferred to v2, named**: token streaming needs its own chokepoint contract (a future ADR). **Corrected in place at A6** (the F4 discipline applied to this row — the A5 verifier's R-A5-6): the original sentence read *"v1 streams turn-level progress only"*, and **A5 shipped no streaming of any kind** — no PubSub, no push. `Samen.Web.AI.AgentLive` reports turn-level progress by **re-reading on every navigation and action**; the id-only-PubSub half of §8/A5 is a live-progress nicety, is NOT a governance property, and is carried as a named A5 residual (§10a row 15, §11). The RULING — no token streaming in v1 — is unchanged and unweakened; only the description of what v1 does instead is now true as written. |
| **6** | **Verifier placement.** Do the agent-coverage assertions live in `ai_prompt_masking` or a new task? | fold in · **new `samen.verify.agent_coverage`** | **New task.** `ai_prompt_masking` means "INV-7 holds structurally"; mixing DX-coverage assertions into it makes a red gate ambiguous. The two genuinely-INV-7 checks (tool-schema boundedness, tool eligibility) *do* go into `ai_prompt_masking` — that split is the point. | **TAKEN — new `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage`**; the two INV-7 checks (d)/(e) go into `ai_prompt_masking` (binds A7). |
| **7** | **The v1 slice.** Which single feature proves the whole chain? | **driftwood support triage agent** · a pawchart vet-record agent · a demo-only agent · a CRM next-step agent | **Driftwood support triage.** It exercises every link in one run: multi-turn planning, a read tool over vault-routed Person fields (masking is *load-bearing*, not incidental), a write proposal through the approval Gate, budget exhaustion on a hard case, and the operator health surface. It also closes a real gap — **`samen_ai_routes` is currently mounted by no vertical**, so the AI kit has a mount seam with no adoption proof. A demo-only agent would prove the loop but not the ≈0-LOC leverage guard. | **TAKEN — driftwood support triage** (binds A6, which also mounts `samen_ai_routes` in a vertical for the first time). |

## 10 · Deferred sub-decisions (explicit, with owners)

| deferred | to |
|---|---|
| `Samen.AI.Agent.Run` field list beyond `{state, current_turn, next_turn_at, budgets, origin, depth, chain}`; the `use Samen.AI.Agent` macro's exact compile-time verifier set | A1 |
| `@turns_per_job` tuning; watchdog interval; the provider-trip threshold | A2 |
| the `tool_schema/0` map's exact spelling; the text-envelope fallback grammar; `fetch_record`'s field-projection rule beyond "catalog-declared + condition-eligible" | A3 |
| ~~the approval `kind` naming for agent-proposed actions; the deadline default~~ — **decided at A4**: ONE registered kind `"ai_agent_write"` (`Samen.AI.Agent.WriteProposal.kind/0`), tenant plane; deadline default **24h**, host-configurable via `config :samen_core, Samen.AI.Agent.WriteProposal, deadline_seconds:` | A4 |
| the per-turn progress copy; the operator health columns | A5 |
| ~~the driftwood goal prompt's content (a versioned `Samen.AI.Prompt` row)~~ — **decided at A6**: the goal prompt ships as the definition's own compile-time-validated literal in `Driftwood.Support.TriageAgent` (EG5-scanned for `vt_` by `use Samen.AI.Agent`), NOT as a `Samen.AI.Prompt` row; see §10a row 20 | A6 |
| `samen.gen.agent`'s switch set and emitted test files | A7 |

Nothing in §4 (the scrub points), §5.3 (propose-then-approve), §6 (fail-honest budgets), or §7
(the proof obligations) is deferrable.

### §10a · A2 implementation deviations (consolidated record, written at A3)

The A2 verifier found five places where the shipped A2 diverges from this ADR's letter. Each is
recorded here with its justification; **none weakens a §9 ratified decision** — the fail-honest
floor, masked-only agent runs, the ratified budgets/retention, and the §4/§6/§7 non-deferrables
are untouched by all five.

| # | Deviation | ADR letter | As shipped | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`bounded_meta/1` naming.** | §6 says the turn log reuses "`RunRecord.bounded_outcomes/1` verbatim". | `Samen.AI.Agent.bounded_meta/1` — a NEW function in the same default-deny posture (plain string-keyed scalar maps only; structs/rich terms dropped, never `inspect`-ed; degrade, never reject). | `bounded_outcomes/1` is coupled to the Automation Run outcome shape (`status`/`error_kind` envelope), not a generic map filter; importing it would have meant exporting a RunRecord internal for a foreign row type. The POSTURE is reused verbatim; the function is the turn log's own. Proven non-vacuous by the A2 jsonb red-path tests. |
| 2 | **Erasure-gate output line.** | §7.4 / A2's gate obligation: `mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness` residual list "byte-identical before/after". | The verifier's output gained a line: A2 ADDED a transcript arm to the completeness discovery (the vault-routed `arn` transcript + its 90-day retention spec is now a discovered, asserted class — sabotage 245 flips when the arm is dropped). The pre-existing residual entries are unchanged. | "Byte-identical" was written assuming A2 adds no discovery; the stricter reading — the gate must now SEE the transcript, or removing its retention arm would be silent — is the one that keeps RP-AG-11 real. A weaker, unchanged gate would have been the actual violation. No new out-of-envelope residue and no new named residual (§7.4's real obligation) holds. |
| 3 | **Four sabotages, not one.** | The §8 A2 row lists "S8 (replayed turn double-executes)". | A2 shipped FOUR patches: 242 (S8 replay reuse), 243 (never-nil watchdog dropped), 244 (kill-switch re-check dropped), 245 (erasure transcript arm dropped). | Strictly additive proof surface: §7.1's table lists kill-recheck (S7) and the watchdog/erasure invariants as obligations of the batches that ship them; A2 shipped those mechanisms, so it shipped their refutations rather than deferring them to a later batch that would not be editing this code. More refutation, same invariants. |
| 4 | **`Provider.Scripted` state in `:persistent_term`.** | The A1 design described a process-local scripted double. | Script + recording live in `:persistent_term` (cross-process; agent suites run `async: false` + `reset/0`). | A2's Oban worker executes turns in whatever process runs the job (drain, watchdog replay, crash-simulation Task); a process-local script would make the worker path fail `{:error, :not_configured}` for scripted work — a dishonestly-honest double. The fail-honest floor (no script ⇒ never `{:ok, _}`) is unchanged. Flagged by A1, required by A2, kept at A3 (the tool-turn worker parity test depends on it). |
| 5 | **`:fail` (and `:cancel`) transition from `:queued`.** | §8/A1 sketches `queued → running → {terminals}`. | The state machine admits `:fail` and `:cancel` from `:queued` as well as `:running`. | A durable `:queued` run can die before its first turn (agent unresolvable, owner gone, transcript shredded mid-queue, tenant cancel before the worker picks up). Without `queued → failed/cancelled`, those runs could either stall forever (violating the never-nil watchdog's *purpose*) or be forced through a fake `:running` hop (a lie in the audit trail). `:exhaust` remains `:running`-only — a queued run cannot exhaust a budget it never spent. |

#### A4 implementation deviations (rows 6–10, written at A4)

Numbering continues the table above. **None weakens a §9 ratified decision** — propose-then-approve
(§9#1) is honoured *more* strictly than the letter, masked-only runs (§9#2), the ratified budgets
and the non-configurable fail-honest floor (§9#3), and the 90-day retention (§9#4) are untouched.

| # | Deviation | ADR letter | As shipped | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **E3 Face 1, not `Samen.Approvals.Gate`.** | §5.3: an `effect: :write` tool "opens an approval via `Samen.Approvals.Gate` — `kind_for(resource, action)`, `subject_ref = "samen:<abbrev>:<id>"`". | A Face-1 handler registered by kind, `Samen.AI.Agent.WriteProposal` (`kind: "ai_agent_write"`, `subject_ref: "samen:atn:<turn_id>"`), the shape ADR-043 §6.3 / T70's `ReplyHandler` already uses. | `Samen.Approvals.Gate` is the **Face-2 change** for *a bounded Ash transition on an existing record with no arguments beyond the record itself* (its own moduledoc, ADR-040 §4.4). An agent tool call is neither: it is a `Samen.Automation.Action` invoked with model-chosen args. §5.3 is written in ADR-040 §4's vocabulary; the mechanism it *describes* — open, park, distinct human decides, execute inside the decision transaction, roll everything back on handler error — is the Face-1 contract verbatim, reused at ≈0 new engine LOC. `Gate` itself is untouched, so T34's "runs as requester, not approver" property is not weakened. `kind_for/2` is still the right spelling for a gated Ash transition; it is not the right spelling for this. |
| 7 | **Execution carries the APPROVER's authority, not the requester's.** | §5.3: on approve the Gate "re-invokes the action **as the requester**, `authorize?: true`" (ADR-040 §4.4's rule). | `execute_approved/3` builds the executing principal from `ctx.actor` — the **DECIDING** party (the `Samen.Approvals.Handler` contract's own definition of `ctx.actor`). A third layer refuses the AI principal as the executing actor even at that seam directly. | On this path the requester is the **AI service principal**, so executing "as the requester" would mean an agent causing a governed mutation to execute *with AI authority* — exactly what **ADR-043 §6.2** ("AI writes do not exist") forbids, §9#1 ratified unamended, and §5.3 itself cites as binding. It is also not what the shipped §6.3 precedent does: `ReplyHandler` does not send as the AI principal either. ADR-040's "requester, not approver" rule exists so an approver cannot **escalate a human requester** beyond their own envelope; it is not a licence to grant a machine principal write authority. Net effect: the AI principal holds no write authority anywhere, and every agent-caused mutation is attributable to the human who consented to it. Kept refutable by sabotage 250. |
| 8 | **A NEW `assign_record_owner` write action, rather than opting in one of the 8.** | §5.1 treats the 8 ADR-039 kinds as the write set; §9#1 names `add_tag` as an example low-risk write. | `Samen.Automation.Actions.AssignRecordOwner` added to the SAME registry, `effect: :write`, opted in. All 8 ADR-039 kinds stay `:not_a_tool`. | The 8 target the fire-time SUBJECT supplied by a workflow trigger (`ctx.resource_key`/`ctx.record_id`); an agent has no trigger subject — it discovers a record via `search_records`/`fetch_record` and names it in the CALL. Retrofitting the agent arg shape onto `assign_owner`'s `validate/2` would widen a validator the Workflow changeset also uses. **A3 set the precedent** by adding read actions rather than retrofitting; this follows it, into the one registry, never a forked allowlist. The kind chosen is the one §1's driving example asks for ("…and who should own it?"). |
| 9 | **The tool-result renderer elides `vt_`-bearing scalars (per value).** | A3 shipped the renderer NOT scanning for the sentinel, leaning entirely on the chokepoint's whole-payload refusal. | `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult` renders a sentinel-bearing scalar (or key) as the bounded `[unrenderable:<key>]` marker, the same exit every other unrenderable value takes. | Recorded as a **correction of an A3 divergence, not a new deviation**: §4.3 step 2 makes `[unrenderable:<field>]` the renderer's general answer to a value it cannot safely emit, step 3 asserts as a property that the transcript "contains no vault plaintext and **no `vt_*` token**", and #6 says the echo is "rendered to a single **`vt_`-free** binary". A3 satisfied none of the three. The A3 verifier also named the consequence: attacker-controlled data in an eligible column hard-failed every agent run touching that record — a tenant DoS. The chokepoint allowlist is unchanged and still refuses any `vt_`-bearing segment (§4.3#5 belt-and-braces, sabotage 247 unaffected); only the normal path stopped routing tenant data through the emergency exit. Sabotage 255. |
| 10 | **Budget + interrupt spellings the ADR leaves open on the write path.** | §6 sets `max_tool_calls` but does not say whether a PROPOSAL bills; §5.3 does not say what a tenant cancel does to a parked run. | A proposal bills **no** tool call (nothing executed) and does **not** advance the turn cursor; the approved EXECUTION bills exactly 1 and advances 1. `Samen.AI.Agent.cancel/2` on a parked run WITHDRAWS the pending approval (`Samen.Approvals.cancel/3` — the requester's own withdrawal, `decided_by` stays NULL) and terminates the run `:cancelled`. | The billing rule is A3's shipped `executed?` semantics applied unchanged ("the counter counts governed executions, not attempts" — the A3 verifier's C7 finding), so a rejected proposal costs a tenant nothing. Not advancing the cursor keeps the `{run_id, turn_index}` row `:proposed`, which is what makes it the idempotency key the approved execution finalizes — a proposal can never double-execute and a park can never be mistaken for a completed turn. The cancel behaviour exists because a parked run has no loop to honour the durable flag at a turn boundary, and leaving a pending approval alive after the tenant withdrew would be a standing invitation to execute a withdrawn write. |

#### A5 implementation deviations (rows 11–15, written at A5)

Numbering continues the table above. **None weakens a §9 ratified decision** — propose-then-approve
(§9#1) is honoured *more* strictly again (the approver is now a verified member), masked-only runs
(§9#2), the ratified budgets and the non-configurable fail-honest floor (§9#3), and the 90-day
retention (§9#4) are untouched. Rows 11–13 close A4-verifier residuals; rows 14–15 record where the
A5 surfaces diverge from the §8 sketch.

| # | Deviation | ADR letter | As shipped | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 | **The approver is resolved through a HOST SEAM, and an unwired host cannot approve.** | §5.3 assumes the approver identity is simply available at decision time (ADR-040 §4's vocabulary); nothing says where a membership is read from. | `Samen.AI.Agent.Approver` resolves `{approver_id, run.org_id}` against the host's materialized Identity `Membership` (config `:samen_core, Samen.AI.Agent, approver_membership:` — a resource module or an `{m, f}` of arity 2) and carries the row's REAL role. An UNWIRED host refuses `{:error, :approver_unresolvable}`; a non-member refuses `{:error, :not_authorized}`. | The A4 verifier's R2: A4 SYNTHESIZED `%Scope{id: <unvalidated argument>, org_id: run.org_id, role: :member}`, so a wholly foreign actor id executed an org write (landed live by the verifier) and every approver was silently normalized to `:member` — elevation for a narrower role, refusal for a wider one. `Identity.Membership` is materialized into the HOST namespace (ADR-004), so the kernel cannot name it; a config seam is the shape `Samen.Approvals.Registry` / `:reveal_grant` already use. Fail-closed-when-unwired matches `:approval_unavailable`'s posture exactly: the failure mode of an unwired host is *"the write cannot be approved"*, never *"the write executed under an invented member"*. The resolved role is recorded token-only on the turn row (`meta.approver_role`), so the consent is attributable to a role as well as a person. Sabotage 257. |
| 12 | **The recursion marker follows `$callers`/`$ancestors`, not just the current process.** | §5.1 says only that an agent tool "may not start another agent run at `depth > 0`". | `current_provenance/0` falls back to walking the spawn chain (`$callers` then `$ancestors`, defensively — dead pids and stale registered names contribute nothing) when the current process dictionary is empty. | The A4 verifier's R3: a tool doing its work in a `Task.async` — the most ordinary way an action does concurrent work — called `start/4` from a child with an EMPTY dictionary, and the nested run persisted as a fresh TOP-LEVEL run (`depth: 0, chain: []`), so `max_agent_depth 0` never bound and the depth accounting could not even see it. The chain the BEAM already propagates for Task/Supervisor (and Ecto/Ash sandbox ownership) is the mechanism the framework uses for exactly this, so the guard rides it rather than inventing a second one. Reachable only by a first-party action module, so this is defence-in-depth; it is still the guard's stated purpose. Sabotage 258. |
| 13 | **A lapsed proposal terminates in a NEW state `:expired`, swept by a SECOND AshOban trigger.** | §5.3 lists `:awaiting_approval → {running, rejected}`; §4.1's watchdog is one trigger. | A `:expired` state + `:expire_due` transition, swept by `:agent_proposal_expiry` (same queue `:automation_timers`, explicit `scheduler_cron`, pinned module names, `where state == :awaiting_approval and next_turn_at <= now()`). Expiry WITHDRAWS the pending approval (the requester's own `Samen.Approvals.cancel/3` — `decided_by` stays NULL), finalizes the `:proposed` turn row `deadline_expired`, appends one bounded transcript line, clears `next_turn_at`, and NEVER executes. | The A4 verifier's R4b: `:agent_turn_due`'s `where` excludes `:awaiting_approval`, so a lapsed 24h proposal sat decidable forever and the run was an unselectable in-flight state — which made the never-nil watchdog's stated *purpose* false as written. Re-arming a parked run through the EXISTING trigger would enqueue a TurnWorker job that can only no-op, so the honest fix is a sibling sweep with its own action. `:expired` is a distinct terminal because `:rejected` would claim a human refused and `:failed` would claim the engine broke. The two triggers now partition every non-terminal state, restoring the MED-2 invariant in full; the §4.1 comment is corrected in place (fold F4). Sabotage 259. |
| 14 | **The durable per-definition kill is a RESOURCE (`Samen.AI.Agent.Kill`), and a rate trip no longer touches the host switch.** | §6's rate trip "trips the **same operator kill action a human uses**" — which at A2/A3 meant the host-level switch. | A new `{org_id, agent}`-keyed row (abbrev `akl`, allocator-reserved; migrations in samen_core/test_repo, driftwood, samen_web/test_repo) recording `reason`/`killed_at`/`killed_by`/`rearmed_at`/`rearmed_by`. `check_start/2` and the loop's per-turn re-check consult `Breaker.killed?/2` = host switch OR this org's row; a rate trip writes the ROW. Kill-row read failure is fail-CLOSED. | The A2/A3 residual `breaker.ex` carried forward verbatim to A5: the rate COUNT was per-org but the SWITCH was host-level, so one tenant crossing its own 60-runs/hour threshold stopped agent runs for EVERY tenant until a human re-armed. §6's sentence is about reusing the same *action* a human uses, not about the blast radius; A5 keeps that (the operator surface throws exactly the lever the trip throws) while narrowing the radius to the offending `{org, definition}`. Durability — not `:persistent_term` — because this row carries a tenant-visible policy decision that a redeploy must not silently clear. The two remaining node-lifetime halves (the host switch, the provider-trip streak) are named in the moduledoc rather than hidden. Sabotage 260. |
| 15 | **The tenant agent surface is `/ai/agents` (+ `/ai/agents/:id`) inside the EXISTING `samen_ai_routes` table, and the decision card's engine round-trip is proven in `samen_core`, not `samen_web`.** | §8/A5 names `Samen.Web.AI.AgentLive` + `Samen.Web.Operator.AgentHealthLive` and "id-only PubSub envelopes + per-viewer re-read". | Both LiveViews shipped; the tenant pair rides `Samen.Web.Router.__routes__(:ai, path)` so a vertical inherits them with the mount it already makes, and the operator page rides `samen_operator_routes/2` at `/operator/agents/:org_id`. **No PubSub was added**: the page re-reads on every navigation/action. The click-to-EXECUTE round trip is proven against the REAL approvals engine in `samen_core/test/ai/agent_write_test.exs`; the samen_web tests prove the card's rendering (token-only provenance) and its REFUSALS. | Adding the routes to the existing `:ai` table is what makes A6's adoption ≈0 authored LOC — a second macro would have meant a second vertical line. The PubSub half of §8/A5 is a live-progress nicety, not a governance property, and **§9#5's ruling is no token streaming in v1** (the descriptive "streams turn-level progress" clause was corrected in place at A6 — see §9#5); the id-only-PubSub live-progress affordance is carried as a **named residual** (§11, "No live-progress PubSub in v1") rather than silently dropped. samen_web's scratch host mounts no `apv_approval` resource, so a full click-to-execute proof there would have meant materializing the E3 engine in a render-test host — the same proof, one plane over, at real risk of drift from the engine samen_core already exercises. The surface adds no second decision path (`AgentReads.decide/3` is a pass-through), so what it owes a proof for is what it renders and what it refuses, which is what it has. |

#### A6 implementation deviations (rows 16–21, written at A6)

Numbering continues the table above. **None weakens a §9 ratified decision** — propose-then-approve
(§9#1) is honoured more strictly again (the deciding party is now an authenticated PERSON, verified
against the host's real membership store), masked-only runs (§9#2), the ratified budgets and the
non-configurable fail-honest floor (§9#3), the 90-day retention (§9#4) and the §9#7 v1 slice are
untouched. Rows 16–19 close A5-verifier residuals; rows 20–21 record where the A6 slice diverges
from the §8 sketch.

| # | Deviation | ADR letter | As shipped | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 16 | **The decision card's acting principal is the AUTHENTICATED session principal, and an unauthenticated caller is refused before the engine.** | §5.3 assumes an approver identity is simply available at decision time; §8/A5 says only that the card decides. | `Samen.Web.AI.AgentLive` reads `:samen_tenant_principal` (pinned by `Samen.Web.TenantAuthz`'s `on_mount` from the SIGNED session — never a param), falling back to the same value `Samen.Web.Live.assign_mount/2` stashes on the mount labels. `nil` ⇒ the click is refused with its own honest copy and nothing reaches `Samen.Approvals`. `Samen.Web.TenantAuthz` additionally resolves the session principal on its DISARMED and operator-plane legs (it previously discarded it there), which grants nothing — org authority stays `:unconstrained` and `Samen.Web.TenantRole` still returns `:admin` on both legs, byte-for-byte. | The A5 verifier's R-A5-3, confirmed live: `Mount.scope(mount, org_id)` on the tenant plane returns `%Samen.Scope{actor: %{id: "broker:<org_id>"}}` — a per-ORG pseudo-principal, identical for every human in the org and never the logged-in user. On a wired host that fail-CLOSED (no membership row exists for `broker:<org>`), which was the right direction but left the shipped card non-functional; and had any host created that membership, an agent write would have been attributable to an ORG rather than a PERSON — the E3 distinct-party CHECK would still hold, but the consent record loses its human, which is the entire point of §9#1. Proven end-to-end on driftwood: the same proposal is refused for `broker:<org>`, refused for an unauthenticated session, refused for a non-member, and EXECUTED for a real `:admin` member whose id is what `aud_chain`'s `approval_approved` row then names. Sabotage 263. |
| 17 | **`Samen.AI.Agent.Approver` refuses `{:ok, nil}` and refuses an approver id that cannot be CAST to the seam's key type; the `nil`-ROLE posture is decided and pinned rather than changed.** | §5.3 says only that the approver is resolved; A5's row 11 established the seam. | `normalize({:ok, nil}, …)` now refuses `{:error, :not_authorized}` **ahead of** the `{:ok, role} when is_atom(role)` clause, and the Ash-resource path pre-checks `Ash.Type.cast_input/3` against the membership's `user_id` attribute, refusing `:not_authorized` (never `:approver_unresolvable`) for an id that provably cannot name a member. The `nil` ROLE is left as-is and PINNED by test. | R-A5-2: `nil` IS an atom, so `{:ok, nil}` — the natural spelling of *"no membership found"* from a custom `{m, f}` seam — resolved to a real `%Samen.Scope{role: nil}`, re-introducing the default-member synthesis A5 closed, one shape over. The cast pre-check exists because the synthetic `"broker:<org_id>"` principal against a `:uuid` `user_id` produced a FILTER error that degraded to `:approver_unresolvable` — a caller problem misreported as *"approvals are not wired on this host"*; both are refusals, but only one is true. On the `nil` role: role gating is the TARGET resource's job. Where a target consults role (`Samen.Policy.RoleAtLeast`, which driftwood's `Work.Task` write path carries) `nil` ranks `-1` and is REFUSED where `:member` is admitted — proven live in the vertical e2e, decision rolled fully back. Where a target consults only `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` there is no role gate to fail open, and the equivalence is intended. Refusing `nil`-role membership in the kernel would instead refuse hosts whose membership rows carry role vocabulary outside the framework's closed set — a host-vocabulary decision the kernel has no standing to make. Sabotage 267. |
| 18 | **The operator agent-health plane distinguishes CANNOT-READ from honestly-empty, and an unreadable kill row is `:unknown`, never `active`.** | §6 makes the operator surface token-only and fail-honest but says nothing about a host that never wired the agent repos. | `Samen.AI.Agent.Health.availability/0` (host wiring seam + a bounded probe read); `summary/3`, `runs/3` and `turns/4` refuse `{:error, :unavailable}` — AUTHZ still refusing FIRST, so an unauthorized caller learns nothing about wiring; `Samen.AI.Agent.Breaker.kills_status/1` returns `{:ok, rows} \| {:error, :unavailable}` (`kills/1` keeps the lossy shape for aggregators); `Health.kill_state/2` is the public tri-state `:killed \| :active \| :unknown`; `Samen.Web.Operator.AgentHealthLive` renders an explicit *"agent plane not wired on this host"* card instead of the empty state. | R-A5-4: `/operator/agents/:org_id` is inherited at 0 LOC by every host mounting `samen_operator_routes/2`, including `pawchart`, which configures none of `:samen_ai_agent_{run,turn,kill}_repo`. Every read rescued to `[]`, so that host rendered the positive claim *"No agent runs for this org"* from a surface structurally incapable of reading one — the ADR-014/024/026 fail-honest contract inverted, because on a DISPLAY an empty list IS a success claim. Same inversion one level down: the kill GATE fails CLOSED on an unreadable row (`definition_killed?/2` answers `true`, every run refused) while the page said `active`. **pawchart and demo are deliberately left unwired** — A6 makes the page they already inherited tell the truth, it does not give them agent tables. Sabotages 265, 266. |
| 19 | **The raw-`spawn/1` recursion-marker escape is DEFERRED to A7's static check, explicitly, rather than closed with a dynamic mechanism.** | §5.1: "an agent tool may not start another agent run at `depth > 0`". A5's row 12 closed the ordinary-concurrency class via `$callers`/`$ancestors`. | No behaviour change. The residual is documented at `@max_agent_depth` and at `inherited_provenance/0` in `Samen.AI.Agent`, and named here as a binding **A7 obligation**: `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` (§9#6) must assert by AST that no `tool_schema/0`-exporting module calls `Samen.AI.Agent.start/4` or `run/4` at all. | R-A5-1, reproduced live by the A5 verifier: a bare `spawn/1` sets neither `$callers` nor `$ancestors`, so a child calling `start/4` persists a fresh TOP-LEVEL run at `depth: 0, chain: []`. Every DYNAMIC closure was examined and rejected: (a) any process-scoped marker is defeated by the same primitive, by that primitive's defining property; (b) a durable in-flight arm — refuse a start whose caller chain is unresolvable while this `{org, definition}` has a tool execution in flight — is the only runtime signal a raw-spawned child shares with its parent, and it REFUSES LEGITIMATE CONCURRENCY (two humans starting the same triage definition in the same org simultaneously is ordinary), trading a real availability bug for a defence-in-depth one; (c) stamping the run/turn row cannot ATTRIBUTE the child to the parent without the caller chain the raw spawn destroyed, so it degrades to (b) wearing a schema change. Reachability is unchanged from A4's R3 — only a first-party/host-authored action module can author the spawn, so this is defence-in-depth, never tenant-reachable. The sound closure is static, costs no concurrency, and refuses the escape regardless of spawn primitive. |
| 20 | **The driftwood goal prompt ships as the definition's compile-time literal, not as a versioned `Samen.AI.Prompt` row.** | §10 defers "the driftwood goal prompt's content (a versioned `Samen.AI.Prompt` row)" to A6. | The prompt is the `goal_prompt:` heredoc inside `Driftwood.Support.TriageAgent`, validated at COMPILE time by `use Samen.AI.Agent` (non-empty, EG5 `vt_`-free — the authored-artifact scan). | The `use` macro validates a LITERAL at compile time; a database row cannot be compile-time validated, so routing the goal prompt through `Samen.AI.Prompt` would have moved an EG5 authored artifact from a checked seam to an unchecked one — the wrong direction for the batch whose job is proving the seam. `Samen.AI.Prompt` remains available for v2 prompt VERSIONING (its actual purpose), and nothing here forecloses it: a future definition may read a prompt row for the per-run system text while the compile-checked `goal_prompt` stays the artifact of record. |
| 21 | **The A6 mount is `samen_ai_routes` over `Driftwood.Crm`, and the vertical's authored agent surface area is a definition plus one router call.** | §8/A6 names a `samen_agent_routes` router macro and "a ~5-line `Driftwood.Support.TriageAgent`", leverage guard "authored vertical LOC ≤ ~10". | No `samen_agent_routes` macro exists or was added: A5 (row 15) put the agent routes INSIDE the existing `:ai` route table, so driftwood's ONE `samen_ai_routes(:ai, Driftwood.Crm, repo: …, labels: …)` call mounts all six tenant AI surfaces including `/ai/agents` + `/ai/agents/:id`. Authored vertical agent code: **13 non-comment, non-moduledoc lines** in `Driftwood.Support.TriageAgent` — of which 8 are the goal-prompt heredoc, leaving 5 lines of actual definition (`defmodule` / `use` / `name:` / `tools:` / `end`), exactly the "~5-line" figure §8/A6 names — plus the 8-line router mount statement and two host config wirings (the `"ai_agent_write"` registry kind and `approver_membership:`). The operator half needed nothing — it was already inherited by the EXISTING `samen_operator_routes/2` call. | A second macro would have meant a second vertical line for zero benefit, which is the opposite of the guard §8/A6 states; row 15 already recorded that decision, and A6 is where it pays. The two config wirings are host SEAMS, not re-implementations: an unregistered approval kind and an unwired membership resource are precisely the fail-closed seams A4/A5 shipped, and driftwood was the unwired host until now. The leverage guard is enforced by a test, not by assertion: `driftwood/test/gate_a6_agent_slice_test.exs` counts the authored lines and refuses `defp`/`Ash.read`/`Ash.update`/`Approvals.`/`Masked`/`PiiResolution` anywhere in the vertical agent module. |

#### A7 implementation deviations (rows 22–24, written at A7)

Numbering continues the table above. **None weakens a §9 ratified decision** — propose-then-approve
(§9#1), masked-only runs (§9#2), the ratified budgets + non-configurable floor (§9#3), the
90-day retention (§9#4), and the driftwood v1 slice (§9#7) are all untouched; A7 authors gates,
a generator, and a red-team arm — no product behaviour. Rows 22–24 record where the shipped A7
diverges from the §7/§8 sketch, and A7 **CLOSES** the A6 verifier's R-A6-1/2/3/5 (see below).

| # | Deviation | ADR letter | As shipped | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 22 | **`mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` is wired into the ROOT `ci.sh` (samen_core, whole-tree scan), NOT the `ci_sh.eex` generated-app template.** | §7.2: the new task is "wired into `ci.sh`, the `ci_sh.eex` template step list, and the generated-app gate". | One ROOT-gate step runs `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` from `samen_core` scanning the WHOLE umbrella tree (the anti-bypass probe technique), so it discovers driftwood's shipped agent and the F-4 lock covers every app's `lib/`. It is NOT added to the generated-app template. | The gate's **non-vacuity floor** (§7.2 check 4: discovery MUST find ≥1 agent) is HOST-SPECIFIC — a freshly-generated app authors no agent until it runs `mix samen.gen.agent`, so wiring the floor into every generated app's gate would fail an agent-less app on principle. This is the exact T134 decomposition `ai_prompt_masking` already took ("NOT wired into the generated-app `ci_sh.eex` template — that cross-cutting generator change is decomposed out"), and the whole-tree root scan is a STRICTER placement than a per-app one (it sees cross-app tool re-entry a per-app run cannot). Carried as a named backlog item (template wiring once a generated app can opt an agent into its own gate). |
| 23 | **`mix samen.gen.agent` scaffolds a DB-free `AgentCase` proof (SCHEMA: NONE), not a run-the-loop test.** | §8/A7 lists "`mix samen.gen.agent` + its templates + a `gen_agent_probe.exs`". | The generator emits the `use Samen.AI.Agent` definition + an `AgentCase` proof that asserts the definition shape and that every declared tool resolves through the four-way intersection's arms 1-3 (`Tools.resolve_definition/1`) — correct-by-construction, runnable in ANY host. It reserves no abbrev and writes no migration. | An agent definition owns NO DB resource — the durable `Run`/`Turn`/`Kill` substrate is framework, shipped once (A1/A2), and a freshly-generated app does not migrate it. A full `run_scripted` loop test would therefore fail in a host without the agent tables, so the emitted proof is deliberately DB-free (the substrate-present loop proof is a few lines away, as the emitted moduledoc says, and `gen_agent_probe.exs` runs the emitted proof for real in `samen_core`, which HAS the substrate, plus its non-vacuity sabotage). Because gen.agent touches no registry, the HANDS-OFF allocator discipline is not engaged and the T107 SHA-256 restore is byte-exact trivially. |
| 24 | **The F-4 raw-spawn escape (row 19 / R-A6-3) is CLOSED by a static AST lock; the leverage guard is now tree-wide (R-A6-1) and near-exactly pinned (R-A6-2); the R-A6-5 doc-hygiene items are fixed.** | Row 19 named the A7 obligation; §7.2 named the coverage checks; the A6 verdict carried R-A6-1/2/5 to A7. | `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` asserts by AST that no `tool_schema/0`-exporting module names `Samen.AI.Agent.start/run` (F-4, with a positive-control red fixture), folds the tree-wide leverage form (a vertical's only kernel-referencing `lib/` files are its agent definitions + router), and the driftwood test ceiling is tightened `<= 18` → `<= 14`. §10a row 15's stale §9#5 citation and §11's missing no-PubSub bullet are corrected. | These are the A6-verifier residuals A7 was scoped to close, discharged exactly. **Carried forward (named, post-ADR backlog):** R-A6-4 (`Approver.normalize({:ok, %{}}, …)` admits an empty membership map as a nil-role scope — the A6 verifier judged this "consistent with the documented map-shape posture" and "strictly narrower than `:member` wherever role is consulted", i.e. not a live hole; closing it would edit the approver clause sabotage 267 anchors against, so it is deferred rather than destabilised at the acceptance gate) and R-A6-6 (the operator decision card is clickable under impersonation but grants nothing — proven live by the A6 verifier; making it read-only under impersonation is UI polish, not a governance fix). Both are documented, not silently dropped. |

#### Post-acceptance additions (rows 25–26, written at T181 and T182)

Numbering continues the table above. This ADR's status is **unchanged (ACCEPTED)** — row 25 records a
post-acceptance ADDITION to the loop, not a deviation from the ADR's letter, and it weakens no §9
ratified decision: propose-then-approve (§9#1), masked-only runs (§9#2), the ratified budgets and the
non-configurable fail-honest floor (§9#3), the 90-day retention (§9#4), the streaming deferral (§9#5)
and the verifier placement (§9#6) are all untouched by it.

| # | Addition | ADR letter | As shipped | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 25 | **The loop gains ONE declared policy seam: `Samen.AI.Agent.Hook`'s seven-point ordered chain (`:session_start` / `:before_completion` / `:after_compaction` / `:after_tool_request` / `:before_tool_call` / `:after_tool_execution` / `:on_error`) with a `{:block, reason}` / `{:edit, call}` / `{:halt, reason}` return contract and first-decision-wins.** (T181; source pattern: Alloy, MIT, `findings/034` item 2 — adapted, not translated.) | The ADR describes every policy the loop applies (§4.2/§4.3 the four-way intersection and the `vt_` arg gate, §5.3 write-via-approval, §6 the budgets) as loop-INTERNAL. It names no extension point, so a host needing one more narrowing rule had nowhere to put it but a fork. | `Samen.AI.Agent.Hook` (the behaviour + the per-point CLOSED `accepts/1` decision sets) and `Samen.AI.Agent.Hooks` (`resolve/1` — host config first, then the per-run `:hooks` opt — and `dispatch/3`, first-decision-wins via `reduce_while`). Six points have call sites in `Samen.AI.Agent`; `:after_compaction` is declared and dispatchable with **no caller**, because v1 ships no compactor. Three new closed `@error_kinds`: `:hook_blocked` (a hook's honest refusal of one call — the run continues under its budgets), `:hook_halted` (a real terminal, never a promoted answer), `:hook_error` (the FAIL-CLOSED degrade). Sabotage 288. | **Hooks may only NARROW, structurally.** `:before_tool_call` fires AFTER the four-way intersection and the action's own `validate/2`, so a hook never sees — and can never admit — a call the loop itself would refuse; an `{:edit, call}` may not change the tool IDENTITY and its args re-run `refuse_vt_args/1` plus `validate/2` before anything is stamped or executed (so no hook can inject a `vt_` token to unmask a field); no hook return approves a write — an `effect: :write` tool still PROPOSES and parks for a distinct human, so **ADR-043 §6.2 stays unamended**; and `egress_opts/3`'s `Keyword.take/2` allowlist is untouched, so no hook can re-enable grant plaintext (§9#2 intact). A hook that raises does NOT degrade to running unhooked — it fails the call closed. The edit binds the EXECUTED call, not a logged copy: `decide_tool!/3` stamps the edited args, so the §4.1 checkpoint-1 digest (and, for a write, the approval binding) is the digest of what actually runs. **One deviation from the `findings/034` source pattern, deliberate:** Alloy's chain is longer — it also carries `:after_completion` and `:session_end`. This seam ships the seven points and omits both: `:after_completion` sits between the provider's bytes and the §3.2a re-scrub, where a hook could observe unscrubbed completion text (an EG2/EG6 egress the seam must not open), and `:session_end` would fire on paths that are already unconditionally terminal, where no decision is left to take — `log_terminal/1` is the honest record there. Two policy seams in one loop is the failure the T181→T184 ordering exists to prevent, so later work extends THIS chain rather than adding another. |
| 26 | **The tool-result chokepoint gains its INGRESS direction: `Samen.AI.Agent.Ingress.sanitize/1`, neutralizing invisible/bidi/control characters and instruction-shaped text into one shared, non-invertible marker before a binary enters `:history`.** *(T182 — see the **PROPOSED** addendum §4.3a; source pattern AlexClaw Apache-2.0 + Pepe MIT, `findings/000`+`findings/006`, adapted.)* | §4.3's six numbered scrub points are all EGRESS — masking, `vt_`, unrenderable shapes. The ADR names no ingress obligation at all, so attacker-reachable tool-result bytes re-entered the prompt verbatim under step 4. | Two clauses in `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult` — `render_scalar/2` for values and `render_key/1` for model-emitted argument names — call one new module. No new dispatch point, no `Chokepoint` public head touched, both loop modes covered by construction. Sabotage 289; sabotage 255 regenerated against the new clause (same defect, same `MUST_FAIL` targets). | Neutralize, never drop: the content stays readable and the marker is visible. Not reversible, structurally: every class collapses to the SAME marker, so the transform is many-to-one and has no inverse. Frame forgery is closed by (a) rather than by a role-word blocklist, so ordinary tenant text is not mangled. Sanitizing BEFORE the sentinel scan only tightens §4.3#3 — the emitted binary is the scanned binary, and the raw value is still scanned, so the pre-T182 refusal is a floor. Carried as a **PROPOSED** addendum rather than an edit to §4.3 because it adds an assertion site to an ACCEPTED contract. |
| 27 | **Tool registries become SURFACE-SCOPED: one `Samen.AI.ToolSurface` abstraction owning a closed four-surface set (`:mcp` / `:operator` / `:tenant` / `:ci_eval`), each with its own registry, that BOTH prior hand-rolled paths now resolve through — so a tool registered for one surface is REFUSED BY NAME on another, never merely absent.** *(T183 — see the **PROPOSED** addendum §5.1a; source pattern Condukt, MIT library, `findings/038`, adapted.)* | §5.1's intersection and ADR-043 §9's MCP server describe two tool sets that never meet, and the code matched: `Samen.Automation.Action.registry/0` and `Samen.AI.Mcp`'s hardcoded `@tool_names` were two registries with no shared abstraction and no way to name a surface, so a cross-surface call came back `{:unknown_tool, name}` — indistinguishable from a typo. | NEW `Samen.AI.ToolSurface` (`surfaces/0`, `registry/1`, `resolve/2`, `surfaces_for/1`, `agent_surface/0`); a new optional `c:Samen.Automation.Action.tool_surfaces/0` declared by the three opted-in tools; `Samen.AI.Agent.Tools` gains arm 5 with arity-preserving heads (no call-site sweep); `Samen.AI.Mcp.call_tool/4` gates on `resolve(:mcp, name)` before a private `dispatch_tool/4`; one new bounded `@error_kind` `:tool_off_surface`. Sabotage 290. | NOT a T181 hook consumer: that chain is optional, host-configured and fires only AFTER the intersection, so hosting a structural registry property there would make the guarantee opt-in. `:mcp` is not declarable from an action (different execution contracts). An action declaring nothing keeps `[:tenant]` — the lane it already ran on, so nothing widens — while a MALFORMED declaration is refused whole and lands nowhere. `:operator` owns NO tools, which is the structural form of §7.3. `:ci_eval` carries the read tools only, because an admitted write opens a real E3 approval. The surface is host config, identical in `run/4` and the durable worker, and never derived from the actor (a lane, not an identity); a typo'd surface disables every tool rather than widening one. |
| 28 | **The tool-result chokepoint gains a THIRD content transform, a secrets-redaction lane pattern-scanning free text for API keys/tokens/connection strings, distinct from the declared-field `pii_*` vault-class taxonomy.** *(T184 — see the **PROPOSED** addendum §4.3b; source pattern Condukt, MIT library, `findings/038`, adapted.)* | `pii_*` governs only DECLARED vault columns; a secret in a freeform, undeclared field carried no vector at all — `:pii_secret` is a generator example never wired into `no_plaintext_pii.ex`, and `redact_payload/1` is a fixed-key `Map.drop` confined to inbound webhook envelopes on a different plane entirely. | NEW `Samen.AI.Agent.Secrets.redact/1` — vendor-shaped prefixes (AWS/GitHub/Slack/Stripe/npm/Google/PEM/JWT/Bearer/credentialed connection strings) plus a fail-closed generic labeled fallback, one fixed marker, called at the SAME two `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult` clauses §4.3a owns (`render_scalar/2`, `render_key/1`), running BEFORE `Ingress.sanitize/1`. Sabotage 291; sabotage 255 regenerated a second time. | NOT a T181 hook consumer, same reasoning as §4.3a restated for a third transform at the identical clauses. Never touches `PiiResolution`/`Samen.Pii.Info`/`render_field/2` — `pii_*` masking is byte-unchanged, proven by re-running the existing masking + `no_plaintext_pii` suites rather than asserted. Redact-before-sanitize is deliberate: ingress noise inserted between an unrecognized secret's label and its value cannot defeat vendor-prefix detection (internal to the token, not label-adjacent), though it could in principle defeat the generic fallback specifically — named, not silently accepted. |

## 11 · Consequences

**Positive.** ADR-043's EG2 class stops being a declaration with no implementation, and
`:history`'s per-turn re-scrub — shipped in T65 explicitly for multi-turn loops — finally has a
caller, so sabotage 44 stops being a proof about a hypothetical. The loop lands entirely inside
the AST anti-bypass probe's and the sabotage harness's coverage, which is the property the Jido
evaluation identified as the decisive one. Zero new dependencies; Reactor, AshOban,
AshStateMachine, Oban, and PubSub are reused where they already fit and deliberately *not* reused
where they do not (Reactor cannot express dynamic step selection; it still runs the tool). The
tool allowlist narrows four ways from an already-governed registry, so "what can the model do?"
has a structural answer, not a policy answer. Agent transcripts land inside the DEK envelope with
a default retention shred, so ADR-046's gate is unaffected. And the v1 slice closes a real
adoption gap (`samen_ai_routes` mounted by nobody).

**Negative / accepted.**
- **Masked-only agent runs (§9#2)** are a real quality sacrifice: an agent reasoning about a
  shipment cannot see the contact's name or email, ever. Named plainly rather than hedged.
- **Propose-then-approve (§9#1)** means an agent cannot complete a task unattended. That is the
  intended posture today; it is also the thing most likely to be revisited first.
- **~2,450 authored LOC plus tests and nine sabotages** is a genuine build, not a weekend. The
  ADR states both the 250-LOC core and the full number so no one is surprised at A3.
- **First interrupt semantics in the codebase.** Cancel is at the **turn boundary**, not
  mid-provider-call: an in-flight tool completes. The UI must say "stopping after the current
  step," not "stopped." Overclaiming here would be exactly the kind of lie the fail-honest
  contract exists to prevent.
- **At-least-once, never exactly-once.** Stated in the moduledoc as Sequences states it. The
  turn row makes double-execution not-happen in practice; it is not a mathematical guarantee.
- **No token streaming in v1** (§9#5) — the honest reason is that streaming needs its own
  chokepoint contract, not that it was forgotten.
- **No live-progress PubSub in v1** — distinct from token streaming: `Samen.Web.AI.AgentLive`
  reports turn-level progress by **re-reading on every navigation and action**, with no
  PubSub push. The id-only-PubSub envelope §8/A5 sketched is a live-progress nicety, not a
  governance property; it is carried as a named residual (the A5 verifier's R-A5-6 / §10a
  row 15) rather than silently dropped.
- **Free text about a third party** in a goal prompt is reached by the run's own retention shred,
  not by that third party's erasure — the same boundary ADR-046 §7#5 carries open. Pointed at
  explicitly so the two are ruled on together.

**Neutral.** The chokepoint's pipeline, the provider behaviour's two callbacks, the D9 grounding
parity contract, the 8 governed actions' existing behavior, the approvals engine, the erasure
completeness discovery classes, and the abbrev registry's hands-off discipline are all consumed
unchanged. `%MaskedPayload{}` gains one field and `%Completion{}` gains one field — both minted
only by the chokepoint / adapters, both in-contract per ADR-043 §11's deferred-fields note.

## 12 · Red paths / verification (the agent-loop adversarial floor)

- **RP-AG-1 (tool-def egress):** a canary/`vt_`-bearing tool definition is refused
  `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}`; sabotage 1 proves refutable.
- **RP-AG-2 (tool-result re-entry):** a tool result carrying a vault-routed field re-enters as
  `••••`, never plaintext, never `vt_*`; sabotages 2 + 3 prove refutable from both directions
  (renderer shape, resolution mode).
- **RP-AG-3 (multi-turn re-scrub on the agent path):** the §3.2a case, now with a real caller —
  and vacuous **by construction** for agent runs because §4.4 excludes grant spans entirely;
  asserted as a property (`no {:grant_span, …} is ever persisted or passed by the agent`), not
  assumed.
- **RP-AG-4 (allowlist escape):** an agent cannot call a registry action it did not declare, did
  not opt in, or its actor cannot authorize; four separate red tests, one per intersection arm,
  each with a positive control.
- **RP-AG-5 (write-never-executes):** no path from an agent turn to a mutating governed action
  without an approve event by a distinct human; approve-then-execute positive control.
- **RP-AG-6 (budget honesty):** exhaustion returns `{:error, :budget_exhausted}` and the last
  assistant turn is not promoted; the rendered surface says so.
- **RP-AG-7 (idempotent tools):** a replayed turn reuses its turn row and does not re-fire.
- **RP-AG-8 (interrupt):** a cancelled or operator-killed run executes no further turn; the
  in-flight turn is allowed to finish and is recorded honestly.
- **RP-AG-9 (EG6 on the agent path):** a forced tool failure, provider failure, and refusal
  produce error terms, log lines, and telemetry events containing no prompt text, no tool arg
  values, no result text, no canary, no `vt_*`.
- **RP-AG-10 (org isolation):** a tool executed in org A returns nothing for org B's records,
  with the same-org positive control (OrgScope FilterCheck — foreign rows do not exist).
- **RP-AG-11 (erasure non-regression):** `mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness`'s discovered
  residue set and named-residual list are byte-identical before and after A2.
