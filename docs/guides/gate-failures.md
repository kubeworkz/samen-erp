# Gate-Failure Index

*Error message → which verifier fired → what it means → the fix* (WS-D D9 / AC-G10-4), for
every `samen.verify.*` verifier plus the gate's drift check. Every quoted error string below
is lifted from the verifier's source, and `samen_core/test/doc_recipes_test.exs` asserts (a)
every `samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.*.ex` task has an entry here and (b) each
quoted load-bearing string still exists in the cited source — the index cannot drift from
what the gate actually prints.

**The shared failure shape.** Sixteen of the seventeen verifiers report through
`Samen.Verifier.halt_if_violations/2` (`samen_core/lib/samen/verifier.ex`) and exit
non-zero via `:erlang.halt(1)`:

```text
FAIL: <task name> found N violation(s):
  • <violation>
```

On success each prints `<task name>: OK — no violations found.` Step numbers below are the
generated app's 18-step `ci.sh` (emitted by `mix samen.gen.app`); Driftwood's 20-step and
PawChart's 17-step gates run the same tiers in the same order.

---

## Step 1b — `schema.dict.json` drift check

**Error** (from the emitted `ci.sh`, `samen_core/lib/samen/gen/templates.ex`):

```text
FAILED: schema.dict.json is stale — run 'mix samen.catalog.dump --output schema.dict.json' and commit.
```

**Meaning:** the committed schema dictionary no longer matches what `mix samen.catalog.dump`
regenerates from the live catalog — you changed a resource/migration without re-baselining.
**Fix:**

```bash
mix samen.catalog.dump --output schema.dict.json
```

and commit the result. (If you did NOT intend a schema change, the diff printed under the
failure shows what drifted — revert that instead.)

---

## Step 2 — `mix samen.verify.catalog_parity`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.catalog_parity.ex`):

```text
uncatalogued column: <table>.<column>
orphan fld_field row: <table>.<column>
ghost table: <table> (resource <Module> not in tam_table)
```

**Meaning:** the physical DB and the `tam_table`/`fld_field` catalog disagree — a migration
created a table/column without `catalog_sync`, or a catalog row outlived its DDL.
**Fix:** every migration must `use Samen.Migration`, end `up/0` with
`catalog_sync(@resources)` and start `down/0` with `catalog_sync_down(@resources)` — the
catalog writes ride the same transaction as the DDL (scope-authoring guide §8). For an
orphan row, remove it via the migration's down/`catalog_sync` pair, not by hand-editing.

---

## Step 3 — `mix samen.verify.prefixes`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.prefixes.ex`):

```text
unprefixed column: <table>.<column> [expected prefix: <abbrev>_, resource: <Module>]
unprefixed fld_field row: <table>.<column> [expected prefix: <abbrev>_]
```

**Meaning:** a physical column (or its catalog row) does not carry the resource's reserved
3-letter abbrev prefix — the global column-naming invariant that makes every storage name
self-identifying.
**Fix:** name the column `<abbrev>_<name>` in the migration (scalar vault fields:
`pii_<abbrev>_<name>`). The abbrev is the one reserved for this resource in
`samen_core/priv/abbrev_registry.json`; `mix samen.gen.resource` gets this right by
construction.

---

## Step 4 — `mix samen.verify.pii_reads`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/samen/pii_reads/harness.ex`):

```text
PII LEAK  <file>:<line>  <sink>(...) <- :<pii_field>  [outside :reveal, <Module>]
PARSE ERR <file>:<line>  <message>
```

and the fail-closed refusal (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.pii_reads.ex`):

```text
FAIL: samen.verify.pii_reads refusing to run against an EMPTY PII registry (0 PII attributes discovered).
```

**Meaning:** source code passes a PII-declared attribute to a sink call (`Logger`,
telemetry, inspect-into-string, …) outside a declared `:reveal` action — a plaintext leak
path. `LAUNDERED …` lines are advisories only (never fail). The empty-registry refusal
means no PII resources were discovered at all — a vacuous check would pass every leak, so it
refuses instead of printing a misleading OK.
**Fix:** route the value through the resource's declared `reveal` action (under a grant), or
stop sinking it — log the bounded ID/token, not the field. For the refusal: configure
`ash_domains` so your PII resources are discoverable.

---

## Step 5 — `mix samen.verify.pii_classify`

**Error** (`samen_core/lib/samen/pii_classify.ex`):

```text
likely-PII column: <table>.<column> (<Module>, logical :<name>, type: :string) — <reasons>
```

**Meaning:** a NEW column (absent from the committed `schema.dict.json` baseline) is
plain-typed but its logical name matches the PII heuristic token-list
(email/ssn/dob/phone/name-ish/…) — you probably forgot the `pii do` vault declaration.
**Fix:** either vault it (cookbook Recipe 5: `pii_attribute` + `pii_<abbrev>_` column) or,
if it is genuinely not PII, register a reviewed `non_pii!` exemption. Then re-baseline with
`mix samen.catalog.dump`.

---

## Step 6 — `mix samen.verify.no_plaintext_pii`

**Errors** — violations print as `[<tier>] <subject> — <detail>` per surface tier
(`domain_rows`, `aud_event`, `audit_chain`, `trace_sink`, `oban_jobs`, `rollup`, `catalog`,
`log_telemetry`, `vault_declarations`; `samen_core/lib/samen/no_plaintext_pii/tier.ex`),
e.g. a domain row holding plaintext where a `vt_*` token must be. Registered exemptions
print as `[<tier>] EXEMPT (non_pii!): …` and do not fail. Mode misuse fails with
(`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.no_plaintext_pii.ex`):

```text
samen.verify.no_plaintext_pii post-shred mode requires `--tiers all` (got ...).
```

**Meaning:** the at-rest oracle found plaintext PII on a surface that must carry only
tokens/bounded values — a write bypassed the `Samen.Vault.Change` chokepoint (raw SQL, a
seed not going through `Samen.Factory`, an un-vaulted 🔒 field). A tier that cannot
introspect its surface reports a violation too (never a silent pass).
**Fix:** write through the resource action path (the vault chokepoint) — for seeds, use the
`Samen.Factory.create!/3` idiom the generated `Seeds` module uses. If the flagged column is
truly non-PII, register `non_pii!` (exempt-but-listed). In post-shred (game-day) mode,
always pass `--tiers all` — a partial post-shred scan is not supported, fail-closed.

---

## Step 7 — `mix samen.verify.migrations`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/samen/migration/down_check.ex`):

```text
<Module> (v<version>): down/0 FAILED — <exception>. Every :expand migration must ship a tested, reversible down/0 (doc §runs 2b).
<Module> (v<version>): rolling down to v<n-1> did not roll back this expand (rolled ...) — check migration ordering / down/0.
<Module> (v<version>): re-apply after down did not re-run this migration (re-applied ...) — down/0 is not a clean round trip.
```

plus config failures: `migrations path does not exist: <path>` and
`no repo: pass --repo or set config :samen_core, :verify_repo`.
**Meaning:** an `:expand`-phase migration's `down/0` is missing, raises, or is not a clean
down→up round trip when exercised in a throwaway scratch DB (`<db>_downcheck_<rand>`).
`:contract`-phase migrations are covered by PITR, not `down/0`, and are skipped.
**Fix:** write the real reverse DDL in `down/0` (including `catalog_sync_down`), and keep
expand migrations additive so the reverse is possible. Never mark an expand migration
`:contract` just to dodge the check.

**`--min-expand` floor (OPT-IN, per-gate):**

```text
--min-expand <N> declared but found only <count> :expand migration(s) under <path> (observed <count>, floor <N>).
```

**Meaning:** the gate declared `mix samen.verify.migrations --min-expand N` and the
discovered `:expand`-phase migration count fell below `N` — e.g. an app's one known expand
migration lost its `phase: :expand` tag (the tag makes it disappear from discovery, not
just from the down/0 exercise). This is OPT-IN: a gate that passes no `--min-expand` keeps
today's behaviour byte-for-byte, including a count of 0 staying green.
**Fix:** restore the `phase: :expand` tag on the migration that should carry it, or lower
the declared floor if the app's expand-migration count has legitimately changed.

---

## Step 8 — `mix samen.verify.sink_schema`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/samen/wide_event/schema.ex`):

```text
field :<name> is typed :string — a FORBIDDEN (name-carrier) type. Wide-event/span fields must be one of [...] (bounded ID / token / enum / number). ...
enum field :<name> declares no closed `allowed:` set. ...
```

**Meaning:** the wide-event/span sink schema declares a field that could carry laundered
plaintext PII into the trace sink — a `:string`/`:binary`/`:map` name-carrier, or an enum
without a closed `allowed:` set.
**Fix:** retype the field as a bounded ID, token, closed enum or number; if you need a
label, make it a closed `allowed: [...]` enum. Free text never enters the sink schema.

---

## Step 9 — `mix samen.verify.metric_labels`

**Error** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.metric_labels.ex` — its own format, not
the shared shape):

```text
[label-lint] FAIL:
  - <Module>: "<metric.name>" uses forbidden tag :org_id
Raw org_id/actor_id/subject_id labels cause unbounded Prometheus cardinality.
Use bounded labels: action, route, result, tenant_tier.
** (Mix) label-lint: forbidden metric tags found — exit 1
```

**Meaning:** a telemetry metric declares a raw per-entity tag (`org_id` / `actor_id` /
`subject_id`) — unbounded Prometheus label cardinality.
**Fix:** drop the tag or replace it with a bounded one (`action`, `route`, `result`,
`tenant_tier`). Per-org analysis belongs in the analytics tier, not metric labels.

---

## Step 9b — `mix samen.verify.oban_queues`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.oban_queues.ex`):

```text
[oban-queue-parity] FAIL: queues enqueued to but NOT configured:
  - :webhooks_in <- Samen.Webhook.IngestWorker
Jobs on an unconfigured queue sit `available` FOREVER — no error, no retry, no DLQ.
Register the queue in Samen.Jobs.default_queue_config/0 (the single source of truth).
** (Mix) oban-queue-parity: unconfigured worker queues — exit 1

[oban-queue-parity] FAIL: discovered ZERO Oban workers.
A parity check that discovers nothing verifies nothing — this is a FAILURE, not a pass.
** (Mix) oban-queue-parity: empty discovery — exit 1
```

**Meaning:** a compiled `Oban.Worker` (hand-written, or one of the worker/scheduler
modules AshOban generates per `trigger`) enqueues to a queue that has no producer in
this app's resolved runtime Oban config. This never surfaces at runtime: `Oban.insert`
returns `{:ok, job}`, the row sits at `state = 'available'` forever, nothing claims it,
and the DLQ stays empty because nothing was ever attempted — so the enqueuing surface
(a webhook ingress answering 200, an operator "replay" button) reports success while the
work silently never happens.

**Fix:** add the queue to `Samen.Jobs.default_queue_config/0` — the single source of
truth. Do NOT add it to a host's `config :samen_core, Oban` `queues:` list: hosts derive
the taxonomy at boot through `Samen.Jobs.install_defaults/1`, and hand-maintained
per-host lists are what caused the drift this gate exists to prevent. A host may list a
queue ONLY to retune its limit (host limits win; omissions are backfilled).

The empty-discovery variant means the `Oban.Worker` introspection itself broke (e.g. a
dependency stopped emitting real worker modules). It fails closed on purpose: containment
over an empty set is trivially true, so a green line there would verify nothing.

---

## Step 13b — `mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.erasure_completeness.ex`):

```text
[erasure-completeness] FAIL: out-of-envelope residues with NO erasure arm:
  - UNREGISTERED derived-linkable column <table>.<col>_bidx (...): a `_bidx`-shaped blind index that is NOT in Samen.DerivedLinkable ...
  - UNREACHED derived-linkable column <table>.email_bidx (...): registered ... but NO :blind_index_erasure_specs entry covers it ...
  - UNREACHED storage_key blob on <resource> (...): NO :file_erasure_specs entry names this file_module ...
** (Mix) erasure-completeness: unreached residues — exit 1

[erasure-completeness] FAIL: discovered ZERO derived_linkable residues.
** (Mix) erasure-completeness: empty derived_linkable discovery — exit 1
```

**Meaning (ADR-046 §6):** `Samen.Erasure.shred/2` is a KEY-destruction job — it makes
every *vaulted* value undecryptable at once, but a plaintext-or-linkable value that lives
OUTSIDE the per-subject-DEK envelope is not reached by key destruction. This gate
DISCOVERS every such residue from the LIVE schema + registries (never `schema.dict.json`,
which grandfathers pre-existing columns — the exact mechanism that let `email_bidx` ship
un-erasable) and ASSERTS a registered `subject_id`-keyed arm reaches each:

- **derived-linkable (`_bidx`) columns** — blind indexes (keyed HMAC of PII) leave an
  equality oracle over the input space that survives a shred. Discovered via the
  `Samen.DerivedLinkable` marker registry plus the structural `_bidx` backstop; each must
  be registered there AND covered by a `:blind_index_erasure_specs` tombstone arm. An
  UNREGISTERED `_bidx` column fails — a new blind index cannot ship silently.
- **`storage_key` blobs** — raw file bytes. A subject-linked blob (the resource carries a
  data-subject field, e.g. `uploaded_by_id`) must be covered by a `:file_erasure_specs`
  blob-delete arm. An **org-asset** blob (no data-subject field, e.g. CRM `attachment` /
  CMS `media`) is NOT a per-subject-erasure residue; it is a NOTE-level org-lifecycle
  residual (deleted on row destroy / retention), named in the output, not gated.
- **`pii_declared`-capable `:custom` bags** — masking is automatic (the resolver reads
  every org's `tnt_field`) and erasure is guaranteed at the `define_field` chokepoint (a
  `pii_declared: true` field is REFUSED unless a `:custom_bag_erasure_specs` arm covers
  the table). The gate asserts both mechanisms are live.

**Fix:** register the missing arm framework-first, never per-host by hand. The specs are
DERIVED from each host's live schema by `Samen.Erasure.install_default_specs/1` (the
`Samen.Jobs.install_defaults/1` twin, called at `application.ex` boot), so a fresh
`gen.app` is complete by construction. A new blind index goes in `Samen.DerivedLinkable`
(logical name → owning-principal subject column); a new subject-linked file resource is
picked up automatically once it carries a recognized subject field.

The empty-discovery variant fails closed on purpose: `email_bidx` + `storage_key` columns
exist in every host that mounts identity + primitives, so an empty residue set is a broken
verifier (containment over an empty set is trivially true), never a green line.

---

## Step 10 — `mix samen.verify.vault_declared_parity`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.vault_declared_parity.ex`):

```text
de-vaulted PII column: <table>.<column> matches the vault storage shape ...
FAIL: samen.verify.vault_declared_parity discovered ZERO resources — cannot verify vault parity. ... A vacuous parity check must not pass (fail-closed).
```

**Meaning:** a physical `pii_<abbrev>_*` column exists in the DB with no matching `pii do`
declared route on any resource — someone dropped the vault declaration while the column
survived (the *de-vault* defect; this verifier reads DB truth, so it catches free-text 🔒
fields the `pii_classify` heuristic cannot). The ZERO-resources refusal is the same
fail-closed anti-vacuity stance as `pii_reads`.
**Fix:** restore the `pii do` block (vault + `pii_attribute` + reveal), or if the field is
being removed for real, drop the column in a proper contract-phase migration. For the
refusal: fix `ash_domains` discovery.

---

## Step 11 — `mix samen.verify.tnt_catalog`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.tnt_catalog.ex`):

```text
orphan tnt_field: org=<org> table=<table> field=<field> (table not in tam_table)
uncatalogued custom field: <table>.<key> (org=<org>, no tnt_field row)
orphan custom-object field: org=<org> object=<key> field=<field> ...
orphan tnt_record: org=<org> object=<key> (no tnt_object row)
```

**Meaning:** the Tier-1/Tier-2 tenant-malleability catalog (`tnt_*`) disagrees with reality
— a jsonb bag carries a custom-field key with no `tnt_field` row, or `tnt_*` rows point at
objects/tables that no longer exist.
**Fix:** custom fields/objects are only ever created through the governed Tier-1/Tier-2
write paths (which maintain `tnt_field`/`tnt_object` rows transactionally) — never write the
jsonb bag or the `tnt_*` tables directly. Repair by replaying the governed path or removing
the orphan through it.

---

## Step 12 — `mix samen.verify.tnt_boundary`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.tnt_boundary.ex`):

```text
system resource <Module> declares relationship <name> ...
FK constraint <name> targets tenant-regime table <table> — no system ...
```

**Meaning:** a system-regime (operator-plane) resource or FK reaches across the two-plane
boundary into a tenant-regime table — the planes must stay referentially separate.
**Fix:** remove the cross-plane relationship/FK; cross-plane reads go through the sanctioned
interfaces (impersonation, the token-blind aggregate plane), never a direct FK.

---

## Step 13 — `mix samen.verify.same_org_fk`

**Error** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.same_org_fk.ex`):

```text
<Module> declares belongs_to :<rel> → <Target> ... `change {Samen.Policy.SameOrgFk, relationships: [:<rel>, ...]}` — the scope-authoring guide §10 mandates a SameOrgFk guard on every org-scoped belongs_to FK (F3.5). ...
```

**Meaning:** a tenant-plane, org-scoped `belongs_to` FK has no `SameOrgFk` change guard — a
write could store a dangling cross-org reference.
**Fix:** add `change {Samen.Policy.SameOrgFk, relationships: [:<rel>]}` to the resource's
create/update actions (exactly what the error message prints).

---

## Step 14 — `mix samen.verify.no_pii_columns`

**Error** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.no_pii_columns.ex`):

```text
aggregate-plane resource <Module> (table <table>) has physical column <col> matching the vault shape `pii_*`. ...
```

**Meaning:** the token-blind aggregate plane physically contains a vault-shaped column —
the aggregate tier must not be able to *hold* PII, by schema.
**Fix:** remove the column from the aggregate resource/migration; aggregates carry bounded
cohort keys and numeric value columns only.

---

## Step 14b — `mix samen.verify.no_pan_columns`

**Error** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.no_pan_columns.ex`):

```text
resource <Module> declares attribute <attr>, which is PAN/CVC-shaped. No samen resource may EVER store a raw card number or a card security code (ADR-038 §3.5 B5 no-PAN invariant) ...
resource <Module> (table <table>) has PHYSICAL column <col> that is PAN/CVC-shaped. ...
```

**Meaning:** a resource (any plane) or a live table carries a column shaped like a raw card
number (PAN) or a card security code (CVC/CVV) — card-on-file must live exclusively in the
hosted billing provider's own vault (ADR-038 §3.5 B5); samen never stores a PAN.
**Fix:** remove/rename the attribute. Non-PAN display metadata (`brand`, `last4`,
`exp_month`, `exp_year`) is explicitly allowed and never flagged.

---

## Step 15 — `mix samen.verify.aggregate_privacy`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.aggregate_privacy.ex`):

```text
aggregate-plane resource <Module> declares no fail-closed cohort ... k-anonymity / l-diversity floors (T4.5) cannot be enforced without one — every ...
aggregate-plane resource <Module>'s cohort spec has no cohort_count_column (k-anon needs a cohort size).
aggregate-plane resource <Module>'s cohort spec has empty value_columns (nothing to suppress when a floor fires).
```

**Meaning:** an aggregate-plane resource is missing its cohort spec (or the spec is
incomplete) — without a cohort count and value columns, the k-anonymity/l-diversity
suppression floors cannot fire, so small cohorts could be re-identified.
**Fix:** declare the full cohort spec on the aggregate resource: the cohort key, the
`cohort_count_column`, and the `value_columns` to suppress when a floor fires (see the
generated app's aggregate resource for the reference shape).

---

## Step 16 — `mix samen.verify.api_contract`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/samen/api_contract.ex`,
`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.api_contract.ex`):

```text
route_dropped: <type> <METHOD> <path> was in the v1 contract but is no longer present — NOTE: semantic breaks ... are not caught by this structural diff ...
field_removed: <type>.<field> was in the v1 contract but is no longer exposed — ...
type_narrowed: <type>.<field> changed type from "<a>" to "<b>" — ...
Snapshot file not found: <path>
```

**Meaning:** the live `/api/v1` contract structurally broke against the committed
`api_contract.v1.json` — a route disappeared, an exposed field was dropped from
`show_fields`, or a field's type narrowed. Additions do not fail; un-versioned removals do.
**Fix:** if the break is intentional, version it consciously:

```bash
mix samen.verify.api_contract --version v1 --update
```

and commit the snapshot (reviewers see the break in the diff). Otherwise restore the
route/field (cookbook Recipe 6). A missing snapshot means the app was never baselined — run
the same `--update` once and commit.

---

## Step 18 — the anti-tautology probe

Not a `samen.verify.*` task: `mix run priv/anti_tautology_probe.exs` sabotages a real
mechanism (the generated app's vault path on `pii_<abbrev>_secret`) and FAILS if the gate
does *not* flip — proving the verifiers above are non-vacuous. If it fails with the gate
still green under sabotage, a verifier regressed: fix the verifier, not the probe.

---

## Off-gate verifiers

This `samen.verify.*` task is not a step of the generated 18-step gate but is part of
the verifier suite (AC-G10-4 covers every task in `samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/`):

> The uncatalogued-column ("hallucinated field") bug class is owned by
> **`mix samen.verify.catalog_parity`** (a live gate step — bidirectional physical ⇄
> `fld_field` parity). The former source-text `column_refs` linter was retired (ADR-045 A3):
> its `^[a-z]{3}_` regex matched the whole Elixir identifier namespace (~1.5k false
> positives) and ran in no gate, adding no coverage catalog_parity + compile-time Ash
> attribute verification don't already give.

### `mix samen.verify.never_read_current`

**Error** (`samen_core/lib/samen/cdc/never_read_current.ex`):

```text
read (<fun>/…) against the CDC analytics repo in a module NOT marked `@cdc_analytics_read true` — never read a 'current' value from the analytics tier (doc line 635). If this is a report, mark the module; otherwise read live truth from the primary repo.
```

**Meaning:** code reads a "current" value from the CDC analytics tier — eventually-consistent
analytics data must never be treated as live truth. With the CDC tier off (the default) the
task prints `Nothing to lint — never-read-current is vacuously satisfied (tier default off)`
and passes; Driftwood runs it as gate step 16b.
**Fix:** read live truth from the primary repo; if the module genuinely is an analytics
report, mark it `@cdc_analytics_read true` (an explicit, reviewable claim).

### `mix samen.verify.ai_prompt_masking`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.ai_prompt_masking.ex`):

```text
<Module>: embeddable field <field> is vault-routed (🔒) — a vault-routed value must never enter vector space (grants never unlock embedding; ADR-043 §7.2). ...
<Module>: Prompt template <name> body contains a `vt_` vault-token sentinel — a committed template must never embed a raw vault FK token (ADR-043 §7.5).
```

**Meaning:** the D2 INV-7 (no-PII-egress) STRUCTURAL gate (ADR-043 §3.4, T65) — the
persisted-egress backstops: (b) a resource declared a vault-routed field embeddable (a vector
outlives any grant and is invertible, so vault values must never enter vector space — grants
never unlock embedding), or (c) a managed Prompt template body embeds a raw `vt_` vault token.
The RUNTIME half — the permanent canary red-team firing a PII canary through every egress class
EG1–EG6 (prompt, tool args, embedding, MCP, grounding, and the EG6 log/telemetry/error shadow),
RP-AI-9/10 — runs under `samen_core`'s `mix test` gate
(`samen_core/test/ai/ai_prompt_masking_test.exs`), sabotage-refutable via
`scripts/sabotages/44-d2-ai-egress-history-remask-bypass.patch` (the §3.2a per-turn history
re-mask) and `scripts/sabotages/45-t65-ai-egress-scrub-shape-blind-tuple-hole.patch` (the
§3.2 step-3 scrub ALLOWLIST — re-opening the tuple/keyword/map shape hole egresses a raw
`vt_*` token wrapped in EG2 tool args). Wired as
a demo/vertical `ci.sh` step (the root gate runs demo's `ci.sh`).
**Fix:** drop the vault-routed field from the embeddable set (or de-vault it); remove the raw
`vt_` token from the Prompt template body — a template must reference values by binding, resolved
+masked at egress by `Samen.AI.Chokepoint`, never embed a raw token.

### `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.agent_coverage.ex`):

```text
<file>: a `tool_schema/0`-exporting module (an agent-callable tool) calls `Samen.AI.Agent.start/run` — this reopens the raw-spawn recursion escape the F-4 static lock forbids (ADR-047 §10a row 19). ...
NON-VACUITY: discovery found ZERO `use Samen.AI.Agent` modules under any app lib/ ...
the agent-run resource Samen.AI.Agent.Run has NO derived `:shred` retention spec ...
<file>: a vertical `lib/` file references the `Samen.AI.Agent` kernel but is NEITHER an agent definition NOR a router ...
```

**Meaning:** the ADR-047 §9#6 coverage gate (batch A7) — the agent loop A1–A6 built is
self-defending. It scans the WHOLE umbrella tree from `samen_core` and asserts: (1) THE F-4
RAW-SPAWN AST LOCK — no `tool_schema/0` module may name `Samen.AI.Agent.start/run` (a tool that
cannot re-enter the loop cannot reopen the raw-spawn recursion escape, ADR-047 §10a row 19);
(2) every opted-in tool declares both callbacks and carries a test; (3) the agent-run resource
carries its `:shred` retention arm (§7.4); (4) a NON-VACUITY floor (≥1 agent + ≥1 opted-in
tool); (5) every agent ships an `AgentCase` proof; (6) the TREE-WIDE leverage guard (a vertical's
only kernel-referencing `lib/` files are its agent definitions + router). Wired into the ROOT
`ci.sh`, sabotage-refutable via `scripts/sabotages/268-a7-agent-coverage-f4-reentry-lock.patch`
(a tool that names `Agent.start` flips the gate red).
**Fix:** remove the `Samen.AI.Agent.start/run` call from the tool module (a tool proposes/reads,
never re-enters the loop); add the missing `AgentCase` proof / tool test / retention arm; move
re-implemented agent behaviour out of the vertical into the framework.

### `mix samen.verify.tool_actor_identity`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.tool_actor_identity.ex`):

```text
<Module> (<kind>): tool_schema/0 declares an actor/org/tenant identity parameter <name> — tool identity MUST come from ctx[:actor] only (ADR-043 §6.2); an LLM-supplied identity parameter can spoof or widen scope.
MCP tool <name>: inputSchema declares an actor/org/tenant identity property <name> — tool identity MUST come from the resolved token scope (ctx[:actor]) only (ADR-043 §6.2/§9); an LLM-supplied identity property can spoof or widen scope.
```

**Meaning:** T185 (backlog OSS-SCAN, findings/009 pattern #2: ZAQ's trusted-execution-context
identity rule, AGPL-3.0 patterns-only) — the STRUCTURAL half of the `ctx[:actor]`-only tool
identity rule (ADR-043 §6.2: "the chokepoint never elevates, substitutes, or synthesizes an
actor"). A tool author could otherwise declare an `actor_id`/`org_id`/`tenant_id` model
parameter — untrusted model output — and a careless `run/2` could read it instead of the
loop-owned `ctx.actor`, spoofing or widening scope. This tier refuses the declaration itself,
FOUNDRY-WIDE across BOTH shared tool-schema surfaces: the `Samen.Automation.Action` agent-tool
registry (`tool_kinds()` — core kinds + host `extra:`, so a generated app cannot slip an actor
param past this gate either) and the `Samen.AI.Mcp` MCP tool catalogue (`tools/0` inputSchema
properties) — not scoped inside any one feature's own work (e.g. T177's OAuth-grant surface).
A name is flagged if it normalizes (camelCase→`_`, downcase, split on non-letters) to a token
set containing `actor`/`org`/`organization`/`tenant`; a target-record field like
`assign_record_owner`'s `user_id` is deliberately NOT flagged (the rule is about the *acting*
identity leaking in as a parameter, not every UUID-shaped arg). Wired into the ROOT `ci.sh`,
sabotage-refutable via `scripts/sabotages/286-t185-tool-actor-identity.patch` (disabling the
`identity_leak?/1` predicate flips both the unit-level defect tests and the exit-code RED PATH).
**Fix:** drop the actor/org/tenant-shaped parameter from the tool's `tool_schema/0` (or the MCP
`inputSchema` `properties`); read the calling actor from `ctx.actor` (Action tools) or the
resolved token scope (MCP), never from a model-supplied argument.

### `mix samen.verify.tool_surface`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.tool_surface.ex`):

```text
<kind>: tool_kinds/0 lists it as an opted-in tool but Samen.AI.ToolSurface.surfaces_for/1 returns [] (on no surface, unreachable anywhere) — a malformed or dropped tool_surfaces/0 declaration.
Samen.AI.Mcp.tool_names/0 (<list>) and Samen.AI.ToolSurface.names(:mcp) (<list>) disagree — the :mcp registry must be read straight from its own source, never hand-rolled.
Samen.AI.ToolSurface.surfaces/0 is <list>, expected exactly [:mcp, :operator, :tenant, :ci_eval] — the closed surface set changed.
<kind>: registered on the :ci_eval surface with effect: :write — a write tool on the CI eval lane could open a REAL E3 approval from a CI run (UXD-11; the :ci_eval surface's moduledoc guarantee).
```

**Meaning:** T183b (backlog UXD-REMEDIATION, `_orch/ux-debt.yaml` UXD-11 + UXD-12) — T183
shipped `Samen.AI.ToolSurface` (ADR-043 §7/§9 + ADR-047 §5.1a, PROPOSED — the one
surface-scoped tool registry: `:mcp`/`:operator`/`:tenant`/`:ci_eval`) with no verifier tier
asserting its invariants, so they could rot silently once the shipping unit test's hardcoded
fixtures stopped being the only thing exercising the property. This tier is the mechanical
fix: (1) every opted-in tool in `Samen.Automation.Action.tool_kinds/0` lands on at least one
surface (a malformed `tool_surfaces/0` fails CLOSED to `[]`, silently uncallable everywhere —
this check turns that silence into a named violation); (2) `Samen.AI.Mcp.tool_names/0` and
`Samen.AI.ToolSurface.names(:mcp)` agree — `ToolSurface` never hand-rolls a second MCP list;
(3) `Samen.AI.ToolSurface.surfaces/0` stays exactly the closed four; (4) every tool registered
on `:ci_eval` is `effect: :read` — the structural half of UXD-11's "a write tool can never
open a real E3 approval from a CI eval run" guarantee (wiring the D8 eval tier itself onto
`:ci_eval` is a behaviour change to another gate and stays out of this tier's scope). Wired
into the ROOT `ci.sh` beside `mix samen.verify.tool_actor_identity`, sabotage-refutable via
`scripts/sabotages/300-t183b-ci-eval-dropped-from-closed-surface-set.patch` (dropping
`:ci_eval` from `Samen.AI.ToolSurface`'s closed `@surfaces` set flips both this tier and the
shipped `samen_core/test/ai/tool_surface_test.exs` suite).
**Fix:** add/repair the tool's `tool_surfaces/0` declaration; keep `Samen.AI.ToolSurface`'s
`:mcp` registry reading straight from `Samen.AI.Mcp.tool_names/0`; restore the closed
`surfaces/0` set to the four named surfaces; move an `effect: :write` action off the
`:ci_eval` surface (or make the action genuinely read-only).

### `mix samen.verify.fleet_wire`

**Errors** (`samen_core/lib/mix/tasks/samen.verify.fleet_wire.ex`):

```text
field type <type> is not a member of Samen.WideEvent.Schema.bounded_types/0 ... — the fleet wire must never widen the inherited discipline
Samen.Fleet.Report.Schema.bounded_types/0 [...] is NOT a subset of Samen.WideEvent.Schema.bounded_types/0 [...]
<host> declares <sentinel> in :fleet_wire_catalogs but the list is empty or malformed ...
P8 smoke-check FAILED for <sentinel>: a label (...) that is NOT a member of the declared closed catalog [...] was ACCEPTED by Schema.validate/2 ...
route <VERB> <PATH> is mounted on <Router> but is NOT in Samen.Fleet.RouteTable.declared/0 (ADR-044 §4.4a) — an undeclared fleet route was added.
Samen.Fleet.RouteTable.declared/0 promises <VERB> <PATH> but <Router> does not mount it.
```

**Meaning:** ADR-044 §5.2 point 4 / §5.2b's "closed member list" premise (WS-J J2,
T84b) — three independent checks: (1) RP-J-4, the `FleetReport` wire's four-class
type discipline (`Samen.Fleet.Report.Schema.class_discipline_violations/0` — no
field of a text-carrying class can exist, so a PII value has nowhere to land) and
that the schema never WIDENS the inherited `Samen.WideEvent.Schema.bounded_types/0`
discipline; (2) P8 (`phase6-punchlist.md`) — a host that declares
`:fleet_wire_catalogs` (`Samen.Fleet.Report.Catalogs`) for one of the four closed-
catalog sentinels (`checks[].name` / `mrr_by_tier[].tier` / `oban[].queue` /
`activity_counts[].event_kind`) gets a LIVE smoke-check proving
`Samen.Fleet.Report.Schema.validate/2` actually REJECTS an out-of-catalog label,
not merely shape-checks it — an empty/malformed declared catalog fails outright; a
host that has not adopted cohort/catalog data at all is untouched (opt-in); (3)
RP-J-4b, the route-surface cross-check against `Samen.Fleet.RouteTable.declared/0`
(ADR-044 §4.4a + §5.3's tier-2 resolve routes) — only runs with `--router
MyAppWeb.Router`, skipped (not a violation) otherwise. Not wired into any
generated-app gate step (fleet cohorts are opt-in, ADR-044 §5.3); a host that
adopts the fleet wire runs it directly (`mix samen.verify.fleet_wire`), and
`samen_web/ci.sh` runs it against the framework's own test fixtures.
**Fix:** for (1), remove/replace the offending field type with one of
`:opaque_id`/`:token`/`:enum`/`:number`; for (2), populate the declared catalog
with the real per-vertical member list (or remove the empty declaration); for (3),
mount the missing route via `samen_fleet_routes`/`samen_operator_routes(...,
fleet_cockpit: true)`, or remove the undeclared one.
