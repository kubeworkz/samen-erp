  @moduledoc """
  `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` — the ADR-047 §9#6 coverage gate (batch **A7**, the
  final batch). Where `mix samen.verify.ai_prompt_masking` means *"INV-7 holds
  structurally"* (and gains the two agent-tool INV-7 checks (d)/(e) at A7), THIS task means
  *"the agent loop A1–A6 built is self-defending and cannot be silently reopened."* The
  split is operator decision §9#6 (TAKEN): mixing DX-coverage assertions into the security
  gate makes a red `ai_prompt_masking` ambiguous, which the thing a security gate must never
  be.

  It mirrors the house verifier shape (`run/1` → `Samen.Verifier.halt_if_violations/2`;
  `violations/1` callable without halting for the anti-tautology test), and is wired into
  the ROOT `ci.sh` (run from `samen_core`, scanning the whole umbrella tree — the
  `Samen.AI.ChokepointAntiBypassProbeTest` technique).

  ## What it asserts

    * **(1) THE F-4 RAW-SPAWN AST LOCK (ADR-047 §10a row 19, the A6 verifier's R-A6-3).**
      NO module that exports `tool_schema/0` (i.e. no agent-callable tool/action) may call
      `Samen.AI.Agent.start/…` or `Samen.AI.Agent.run/…` — the two loop-entry primitives.
      A6 found this property already-true of the shipped code and proved (live) that the
      raw-`spawn/1` recursion-marker escape is defence-in-depth, unreachable from tenant
      data. This gate LOCKS IT IN by static AST scan so a future edit cannot reopen the
      raw-spawn recursion escape: a tool that cannot even name `Agent.start/run` cannot
      re-enter the loop, regardless of which spawn primitive it reaches for. This is the
      single most load-bearing assertion in this task, and its positive control (a fixture
      tool that DOES call `Agent.start` MUST flip the scan) is the anti-tautology proof.

      **Alias resolution (UXD-05).** A `List.last(parts) == :Agent` test is blind to every
      NAME-BINDING form that gives the kernel a different spelling, so `alias_env/1` builds
      the file's ALIAS ENVIRONMENT and `resolves_to_kernel?/3` applies Elixir's own
      resolution rule — head-segment substitution — to every module reference. WHAT THIS
      CLOSES, in all five call shapes (direct-call, `apply/3`, `Kernel.apply/3`,
      `:erlang.apply/3`, pipe): a rename of the kernel itself (`alias Samen.AI.Agent, as: A`);
      a rename of ANY PREFIX segment at any depth (`alias Samen.AI, as: A` then
      `A.Agent.start/…`, or `alias Samen, as: S` then `S.AI.Agent.start/…`); a chain of
      either through further `as:` hops of any depth, in either declaration order; the brace
      form (`alias Samen.AI.{Agent, …}`, including on a renamed prefix); an alias declared
      inside a function body rather than at the top of the module; a name declared twice
      (shadowing — BOTH right-hand sides count); Elixir's OTHER alias-creating form,
      `require Samen.AI.Agent, as: A` (and the prefix form `require Samen.AI, as: A`),
      including when it seeds a further `alias`/`require` chain — added at UXD-05 attempt 4,
      `require_bindings/1`; an ATOM alias target, `alias :"Elixir.Samen.AI.Agent", as: A`,
      which `Code.string_to_quoted/2` yields with no `__aliases__` wrapper — also attempt 4,
      the atom clause of `alias_bindings/1`; and a `__MODULE__`-relative or otherwise
      statically unresolvable prefix, which is re-tested on its literal suffix alone. The
      raw, unexpanded reference is tested too, so this check is a strict SUPERSET of the
      pre-fix literal one. See `resolves_to_kernel?/3` for the termination argument — no
      alias cycle, and no self-growing alias such as `alias A.B, as: A`, can hang the scan.

      **KNOWN RESIDUALS — DOCUMENTED, NOT CLOSED.** This lock is a static AST scan of one
      file at a time. It does NOT catch, and does not claim to:

        1. **Dynamic module construction.** `mod = Module.concat(Samen.AI, Agent);
           apply(mod, :start, [...])`. No `__aliases__` node and no atom literal names the
           target at the call site, so there is nothing static to resolve — a DISTINCT
           vulnerability class from an alias rename (which is a compile-time textual
           substitution the AST still names). Closing it needs data-flow/taint tracking and
           should be scoped as its own item, not folded in here silently.
        2. **The unparsable-source fallback.** When `Code.string_to_quoted/2` fails, the
           scan degrades to `reentry_regex_fallback?/1`, a hardcoded literal-name regex with
           NO alias tracking at all: every rename above evades that branch. It is reached
           only by source that does not compile.
        3. **Indirection through another module or a macro.** A reference the kernel gains
           only after macro expansion, or a call routed through a helper module in a
           different file, is invisible to a per-file pre-expansion scan.
        4. **MODULE-ATTRIBUTE INDIRECTION** (UXD-05 attempt 4, named here because it was
           found live and silent; PARTIALLY CLOSED AT A9). `@k Samen.AI.Agent` followed by `@k.start(...)`
           or `apply(@k, :start, [...])` INSIDE a `tool_schema/0` module was a working call
           this lock did not flag. A9 closed the single, static, TOP-LEVEL ASSIGNMENT case:
           `attr_env/1` (new) collects every top-level `@name <value>` assignment the same
           way `alias_env/1` collects `alias`/`require` bindings, and `agent_kernel_alias?/2`
           gained an `{:@, _, _}` clause resolving an attribute reference through the same
           alias/atom machinery every other reference uses — so the worked example above IS
           FLAGGED NOW. What A9 deliberately did NOT attempt, and what remains open:
           attribute REASSIGNMENT ordering, ACCUMULATION (`Module.register_attribute/3,
           accumulate: true`), and attribute-of-attribute CHAINING (`@k @j`, one attribute
           assigned from another) — each is data-flow through a binding, the same class
           residual 1 (dynamic module construction) already declines to fold in. This is a
           STATED, TESTED limit: the closed case is pinned by the "RED FIXTURE (A9)" tests
           and the open chaining case by "KNOWN RESIDUAL (A9, still open) — attribute-of-
           attribute chaining" in `test/ai/agent_coverage_verifier_test.exs`.

      Residuals 1 and 4 are pinned by negative-control tests, and a further test asserts
      this paragraph is still present in this source, so deleting any disclosure above
      turns it red (`test/ai/agent_coverage_verifier_test.exs`, the "KNOWN RESIDUAL" tests).

      **Unqualified `import`.** `import Samen.AI.Agent` binds `start/…` and `run/…` as bare
      names, which no qualified-call clause can see. `imported_kernel_reentry?/2` closes
      that: when a file imports the kernel (resolved through the same alias environment), a
      bare `start(…)`/`run(…)` call counts as reentry. `def`/`defp` heads are stripped first
      so a module's own `def start(…)` definition is never mistaken for a call.

    * **(2) every opted-in tool declares BOTH callbacks and carries a test** (ADR-047 §7.2
      check 2). Every kind in `Samen.Automation.Action.tool_kinds()` exports `tool_schema/0`
      AND `effect/0`, and at least one test file names the kind.

    * **(3) the agent-run resource carries a retention `:shred` spec** (ADR-047 §7.4 /
      §9#4) — erasure reach is a coverage FACT, not a hope. `Samen.Erasure.default_specs/1`
      must derive a `:shred` retention arm for `Samen.AI.Agent.Run`.

    * **(4) NON-VACUITY FLOOR** (ADR-047 §7.2 check 4; the ADR-046 E7 lesson — *a gate that
      discovers nothing verifies nothing*). Discovery MUST find ≥1 agent (a `use
      Samen.AI.Agent` module in the tree) and ≥1 opted-in tool, else FAIL.

    * **(5) every discovered agent ships an `AgentCase` proof** (ADR-047 §7.2 check 1) — a
      test file that both names the agent module and `use`s `Samen.AgentCase`.

    * **(6) THE TREE-WIDE LEVERAGE GUARD** (the A6 verifier's R-A6-1). The shipped
      driftwood leverage guard read ONE file; it could not catch framework agent behaviour
      re-implemented in a DIFFERENT vertical module — the exact evasion the guard forbids.
      This folds the tree-wide form in: in every vertical (`driftwood`/`pawchart`/`demo`),
      the only `lib/` files that may reference the `Samen.AI.Agent` kernel are the agent
      DEFINITION modules (`use Samen.AI.Agent`) and the ROUTER (`samen_ai_routes`).

  ## Scope of the scan

  The AST/text scan walks every app's `lib/` (the anti-bypass probe's `@app_lib_globs`),
  never `test/` or `deps/` — a test fixture that calls `Agent.start` from a
  `tool_schema/0` module is legitimate proof material, not a shipped hole.

  # --- the alias environment (UXD-05, attempt 3) -----------------------------------------
  #
  # THE RULE, not a pattern for the last bug. In Elixir every `alias` form binds a single
  # atom (its FIRST segment when used) to a list of parts, and a module reference
  # `[Head | Rest]` resolves by replacing `Head` with its binding and re-resolving:
  #
  #   * `alias P.Q.R`          -> binds `R`  to `[:P, :Q, :R]`  (implicit `as:` = last segment)
  #   * `alias P.Q.R, as: X`   -> binds `X`  to `[:P, :Q, :R]`
  #   * `alias P.Q.{R, S}`     -> binds `R`  to `[:P, :Q, :R]` and `S` to `[:P, :Q, :S]`
  #
  # The right-hand side is stored UNEXPANDED and expanded on lookup, so the environment is
  # order-independent by construction (a rename may legally be written above the alias it
  # renames) and a PREFIX rename resolves at any depth: `alias Samen.AI, as: A` binds `A` to
  # `[:Samen, :AI]`, so the reference `A.Agent` resolves to `[:Samen, :AI, :Agent]` — the
  # case that evaded attempts 1 and 2 in all five call shapes, and the case a further
  # `alias A.Agent, as: B` was built on.
  #
  # A name declared twice (shadowing) keeps BOTH right-hand sides and a reference counts as
  # the kernel if EITHER resolves there — a static security scan over-approximates on
  # purpose. For the same reason `resolves_to_kernel?/3` tests the raw, unexpanded parts as
  # well, which makes this check a strict SUPERSET of the pre-fix literal one: it can flag
  # strictly more than before, never less.

  #
  # `@k Samen.AI.Agent` then `@k.start(...)` was residual 4: a module attribute is a
  # THIRD name-binding form (after `alias`/`require`) that never entered `alias_env/1`.
  # `attr_env/1` collects every top-level `@name <value>` ASSIGNMENT in the module —
  # `{:@, _, [{name, _, [value]}]}`, distinguished from a REFERENCE `{:@, _, [{name, _,
  # ctx}]}` by the third element being a one-element LIST (the assigned value) rather than
  # `nil`/a context atom. Same shadowing rule as `alias_env/1`: a name assigned more than
  # once keeps EVERY assigned value, and a reference counts as the kernel if ANY resolves
  # there — over-approximate on purpose, never under-approximate a security scan.
  #
  # SCOPE, DELIBERATELY NOT WIDER: this closes the single, static, literal assignment the
  # residual named and the negative-control test pins (`@k Samen.AI.Agent`). It does NOT

  # construction) already declines to fold in. `agent_kernel_alias?/2`'s new `{:@, _, _}`
