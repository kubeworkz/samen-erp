defmodule Samen.Scopes.Identity.Notify do
  @moduledoc """
  Identity's `notify` half of the ADR-035 §5 A10 auth-event fan-out (T09's
  contract). Every `auth.*` event kind in the A10 taxonomy table lands BOTH in
  the `aud_event` tier (`Samen.Scopes.Identity.Audit.auth_event/2`) AND,
  where the taxonomy marks it `✓`, dispatches an in-app notification through
  the KERNEL `Samen.Notifications.Engine` (record + suppression-aware
  dispatch + id-only PubSub envelope — the engine's existing contract,
  unchanged). This module is the identity-specific CALLER seam over that
  engine: it resolves an `auth.*` event's recipient (an opaque credential id)
  to the `{org_id, user_id}` pair the engine's `notify/emit` request shape
  requires, and builds a TOKEN-BLIND body.

  ## Token-blind by construction (ADR-035 §5 A10)

  `rendered_body` here is ALWAYS a fixed, operator-authored copy string —
  never string-interpolated with an email address, a raw token, or any other
  vaulted field. The Notification record's `rendered_body` column is itself
  vault-routed (`Samen.Notifications.Engine`'s own PII discipline), so even a
  token-blind body is stored encrypted at rest — but the bar this module
  holds is stricter: the body never CONTAINS PII in the first place, so no
  masking proof is even reachable through this seam (INV-1's belt AND
  braces — vault-routed storage, and nothing sensitive ever enters the
  string).

  ## Recipient resolution — no new lookup primitive

  `Identity.User` already carries its own `org_id` (set at creation —
  `Samen.Identity.Register.create_user/3`, `Samen.Identity.Invite`'s join,
  `Samen.Identity.OidcLink`'s provision path). Resolving a credential's
  notification recipient is therefore a single `User` read filtered on
  `credential_id` — no new join table, no `Samen.Auth.OrgActor` dependency
  (that module resolves ROLE-bearing per-org ACTORS for authorization
  decisions; this module only needs an org+user pair to address a
  notification). A credential linked to more than one org's `User` (the
  A5/T05 invite-join case) notifies the FIRST resolved org only — documented
  as this module's one simplification, not a correctness gap (the credential
  owner sees the notice in at least one org's inbox either way).

  ## Best-effort, never a regression on the primary write (the SlaBreachWorker/
  chat "chat_mention" precedent)

  Every function here calls through `Samen.Notifications.Engine.emit/2` (the
  BEST-EFFORT half of the engine's public API — never raises, logs and
  returns `{:error, reason}` on an unwired/failed engine) and additionally
  never raises itself: an unresolvable recipient (`:error` from
  `resolve_recipient/2`) is a quiet no-op, not a crash. The auth-lifecycle
  write this rides alongside (email verify, password reset, 2FA
  enroll/disable, recovery-code consume) is ALWAYS the load-bearing act;
  losing a notification is never allowed to unwind it.
