defmodule Samen.Scopes.Cms.PublicPostFilter do

  The `Post.:read_public` preparation (T78, spec §I5) — bakes the tenant-portal's
  read scope into the query itself: `org_id == the caller's :org_id argument AND
  status == :published AND visibility == :public`. A SEPARATE TOP-LEVEL module
  (NOT inlined as `expr(...)` inside `Samen.Scopes.Cms.Blueprint.define_post/5`'s
  `quote do` body, and NOT nested inside `Blueprint`'s own `do...end` — Elixir's
  lexical `defmodule` nesting would then prefix its real name with
  `Samen.Scopes.Cms.Blueprint.`, silently breaking the `prepare(...)` reference
  below) — an inline `expr` inside the blueprint's quote is hygiene-captured to
  the Blueprint module's own compile context (`undefined variable "org_id"`),
  the exact bug class the Identity blueprint's `OrgIsSelf` moduledoc warns about
  ("an inline `expr(id == …)` here would be hygiene-captured inside the
  blueprint's quote"). This module compiles once, normally, outside any macro
  expansion, so `Ash.Query.filter/2`'s own `expr`-equivalent macro sees real
  field references — no hygiene issue.

  Every `:read_public` caller is UNAUTHENTICATED (no actor at all — the portal
  has no session), so this filter is the ENTIRE authorization surface for the
  action (paired with a `bypass` policy, not a `policy`, on the resource — see
  `Post`'s `policies do` block in `Samen.Scopes.Cms.Blueprint.define_post/5`).
  It cannot be relaxed by a caller's own query: `Ash.Query.filter/2` composes
  with AND, it never replaces a prior filter.

  Resource-definition macros for the CMS scope (T3.5; ADR-004 blueprint).

  Objects: `page · post · block · media · navigation · seo_meta`
  (doc §"The inherited 80%" scope table). The bespoke `content_version` ledger was
  RETIRED in T119 (ADR-040 §6.5): content history is now the E7 audit-on-write
  `versioned: :snapshot` mechanism (ash_paper_trail-generated `Page.Version` /
  `Post.Version` / `Block.Version`).

  ## PII map (🔒)

  The CMS scope contains NO vault-routed PII objects — the doc's 🔒 map has no
  mark on any CMS resource. Content is the product's authored output, not subject
  identity data.

  ## Non-PII classification (mask-unknown-by-default proof)

  `Samen.NonPii` D9 requires EVERY field type to be classified — fields that are not
  classified default to PII (masked). Free-text CMS fields are explicitly classified
  as non-PII by design (the mask-unknown-by-default proof for this scope). The
  `pii_classify` heuristic (C4) does not flag most of these because their names
  (`title`, `body`, `content`, `slug`) are not in the PII name-token list. However,
  the task spec (T3.5) requires the non-PII classification to be documented and
  proven.

  Fields that receive deliberate non-PII classification via `Samen.NonPii.register/1`
  (registered in the demo's seed task / test setup with distinct reviewers):

  | Table       | Column          | Non-PII rationale                                      |
  |-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
  | cpg_page    | cpg_title       | Published page title — authored content, not PII       |
  | cpt_post    | cpt_title       | Blog post title — authored content, not PII            |
  | csm_seo_meta| csm_description | SEO description — authored marketing copy, not PII     |

  `csm_description` is the most important registration: "description" can resemble
  a free-text name-containing field, so the non-PII! classification is load-bearing
  documentation. Without it, an auditor might question whether authored descriptions
  could leak subject names. The explicit registration + distinct-reviewer sign-off
  proves the field was consciously evaluated and cleared.

  See `Demo.CmsScope.NonPiiSetup` for the runtime registration calls.

  ## Draft → publish workflow

  `Page` and `Post` have a `status` bounded enum:
  `:draft | :published | :archived`. Publish is admin-gated (`RoleAtLeast :admin`).
  Every tracked write on `Page`/`Post`/`Block` (create/update/publish/mark_archived/
  archive/restore) records a full-row `<Module>.Version` snapshot automatically via E7
  `versioned: :snapshot` (ADR-040 §6.5) — content changes are auditable and reversible
  by construction, with no caller obliged to snapshot.

  ## Intentional policy divergence — content :update is member-level (F3.4)

  Most scopes gate ALL writes behind a role floor (`create/update/destroy` require
  admin+). CMS `Page`/`Post` **deliberately diverge**: the default `:update` action
  (a content edit — editing draft body/title) is authorized at `OrgScope` ONLY, so
  any org member may edit content, while the *lifecycle* transitions
  `:publish`/`:archive` (Tier-0 state changes with external visibility) DO require
  admin+. This is the correct CMS RBAC shape — an editorial team edits drafts; only
  an admin publishes. It is called out here (and in scope-authoring guide §7) so the
  divergence is an **explicit, documented choice**, not silent policy drift. Every
  other CMS write resource (`Block`, `Media`, `Navigation`, `SeoMeta`) follows the
  standard admin-gated split-read/split-write idiom.

  ## Content history — E7 `versioned: :snapshot` (ADR-040 §6.5, T119)

  Content history is the E7 audit-on-write mechanism: `Page`/`Post`/`Block` declare
  `versioned: :snapshot`, so ash_paper_trail generates a governed `<Module>.Version`
  resource (allocator-owned abbrev, prefixed columns, mirrored `org_id`, OrgScope,
  catalog, `no_plaintext_pii` roster — §6.2) and records a full-row snapshot on every
  tracked write. The retired bespoke `ContentVersion` was a pre-1.0 destructive break
  (§6.5): it required callers to remember `:create_version` (which the lifecycle never
  actually did), whereas E7 versions by construction. History is read from the Version
  resources; version rows never persist raw action inputs (`store_action_inputs? false`,
  INV-1). This tier stays disjoint from the governance `aud_event` hash-chain (§7.4).

  ## Tier-0 config rows

  `Navigation` is the CMS Tier-0 config-row resource: one row per navigation item
  per org (e.g. main menu entry, footer link). Admins bend the nav structure without
  forking the product.

  ## Soft-delete adoption (ADR-040 §5.9, T37b) — `page ▸cascade block, post, media,
  ## navigation, seo_meta`

  Five of the six writable resources are `archivable: true`: `page`, `post`,
  `media`, `navigation`, `seo_meta`. `block` is archivable too, and is the ONE
  declared composition cascade in this scope: archiving a `page` cascades to
  archive its `block`s at the same instant (`Samen.Scopes.Cms.CascadeArchive`),
  and restoring a `page` restores exactly the same-instant-archived blocks
  (`Samen.Scopes.Cms.CascadeRestore`) — see those modules' docs for why this
  scope does NOT use ash_archival's `archive_related` DSL option directly.
  `seo_meta`'s `page`/`post` belongs_to relationships are NOT cascades (§5.4
  default no-cascade) — an archived page/post's seo_meta row stays live but its
  relationship load correctly resolves to `nil` (the read-preparation leak
  surface every adopting scope must red-test, §5.5).

  The former `content_version` ledger is retired (T119, ADR-040 §6.5) — replaced by
  the E7 `versioned` Version resources, which are neither archivable nor themselves
  versioned (a version of a version is meaningless).

  ### The `:archive` name collision — `page`/`post`'s pre-existing content-status
  ### action renamed to `:mark_archived`

  `Page` and `Post` already had a hand-authored `update :archive` action (sets
  the `status` enum to `:archived` — a content-workflow/visibility transition,
  draft → published → **archived**, wholly independent of soft-delete). ADR-040
  §5.2 reserves the name `:archive` for the E6 substrate's own destroy action
  (`use Samen.Resource, archivable: true` injects `destroy :archive`). Two
  actions cannot share one name on the same Ash resource, so the pre-existing
  content-status action is renamed `:mark_archived` here (same body, same
  policy gate — admin-gated alongside `:publish`). This is a NEW resolution
  pattern (the first resource in the foundry where a business-domain action
  collided with an E6-reserved name); every other CMS action name is
  untouched. The `status` enum itself still has an `:archived` VALUE (data,
  not an action name) — no collision there, only the action needed renaming.

  ## Storage-name discipline

  Every column is `<abbrev>_<name>` (self-qualifying storage, injected by the Samen
  base macro). The public API/catalog only ever sees the logical name, never the
  storage name.

        `set_attribute`'d. History is read from `<Module>.Version` (the retired bespoke
        `ContentVersion` is gone — §6.5). No caller need remember to snapshot.

        rows referencing an archived Post stay live, per the belongs_to

        ## `visibility` — the helpdesk knowledge-base reuse seam (T78, spec §I5)

        `Post` doubles as the helpdesk KB article resource ("no parallel article
        resource" done-criterion): `visibility` (`:internal | :public`, default
        `:internal`) distinguishes an agent-only article from one deflectable to
        the unauthenticated tenant portal. A post is portal-visible ONLY when
        BOTH `status == :published` AND `visibility == :public` — the `:read_public`
        action below bakes both conditions into its action-level `filter` (never
        removable by a caller's own query, unlike a policy-level FilterCheck a
        second matching policy could weaken) plus an explicit `org_id` argument
        (the portal has no authenticated actor to scope by). An internal article
        (any status) stays reachable ONLY through the default org-scoped `:read`
        (agents), never through `:read_public`.

        `embeddable: [:title, :body]` (ADR-043 §7.2, D3) opts every Post into the
        AI-plane semantic-search index (`Samen.AI.Embeddings`) — the retrieval
        mechanism for composer suggestion + deflection. Both fields are already
        classified non-PII (authored content, see the blueprint moduledoc), so
        the deny-by-default embeddable allowlist is satisfied honestly. The
        vector index is CANDIDATE RETRIEVAL ONLY — every consumer re-verifies a
        hit's source record against the caller's own scoped read action
        (`:read_public` for the portal, the default `:read` for agents) before
        ever rendering it, so a stale/over-broad vector can never surface
        content the reader is not otherwise authorized to see.

          # declared BEFORE the generic `policy action_type(:read)` block below
          # (the `Samen.Scopes.Automation.Blueprint` `:dispatch_due`/`:scan_due`
          # precedent — Ash's policy engine evaluates top-to-bottom and a
          # regular `policy` block that FAILS can decide the whole request
          # forbidden before a LATER bypass is ever reached; declared first, the
          # bypass's own PASS short-circuits immediately, skipping every policy
          # below it entirely — verified live: declaring this bypass AFTER the
          # generic read policy left `:read_public` permanently forbidden
          # despite the bypass matching). `:read_public` is still
          # `action_type(:read)`, so the generic read policy would otherwise
          # ALSO match and AND its actor-derived `OrgScope` filter in — an
          # actor-less caller would then see ZERO rows regardless of the
          # action's own filter, silently defeating the portal. Safe because
          # the action's own baked-in preparation filter (`PublicPostFilter`,
