defmodule Samen.OperatorPlane.Actor do
  @moduledoc """
  The **operator-plane actor** (T4.1 clause (a); doc §control "Running the business").

  Operator actors are a DISTINCT actor type — NOT tenant members. They run the
  business: an operator CRM where accounts ARE tenant orgs, ticketing over tenant
  support, cross-tenant billing rollups. Their RBAC is their own (`operator_role`),
  separate from the tenant `Samen.Scope.Role` set.

  ## Why a distinct type (not a tenant member with god-mode)

  The doc's two-planes idiom keeps the operator plane and the tenant plane as separate
  actors over the same objects. An operator is never "a member of every org" — that
  would collapse the boundary. Instead an operator holds ONE of a small operator-role
  set, and reaches a specific tenant org ONLY through a short-TTL impersonation session
  (`Samen.Impersonation`), never by carrying a tenant `org_id` ambiently.

  ## Operator roles (own RBAC)

    * `:operator_admin`   — can open impersonation sessions, read the operator CRM,
      manage operator-plane config.
    * `:operator_support` — can open impersonation sessions and read the operator CRM
      (the day-to-day support role).
    * `:operator_readonly`— read the operator CRM only; may NOT open impersonation
      sessions.
    * `:operator_break_glass` — the SINGLE, named break-glass role (T4.4). The only
      role `Samen.BreakGlass.authorized?/1` accepts. By convention there is exactly
      one such role (not a per-scope grab-bag), so "who could break glass" is a
      single small reviewable set. It may also impersonate (it is a superset
      emergency role), but its distinguishing capability is the emergency reveal.

  These are deliberately NOT the tenant roles (`:owner/:admin/:member/:viewer`) — an
  operator is a different principal class. `may_impersonate?/1` gates who can open a
  session.

  ## The actor shape (what the operator plane sees)

    * `:id`            — the operator's id (opaque uuid) — bounded, never PII.
    * `:operator_role` — one of the operator-role set above.
    * `:kind`          — always `:operator` (marks the plane; the tenant plane never
      sets this, so a policy can tell them apart).

  No name/email/PII is placed on the operator actor — like the tenant actor, it is an
  authorization subject, not a profile (safe to log: bounded id + enum role).
