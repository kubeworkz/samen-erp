defmodule Samen.Automation.Context do
  @moduledoc """
  The fire-time context handed to every `Samen.Automation.Action` (ADR-039 §5.1).

  Carries ONLY bounded ids/enums/refs + the governed subject re-read (a map of
  condition-eligible attributes — never a vault field). `actor` is the workflow
  OWNER re-resolved at run time (ADR-039 §4.5): every action executes through
  governed Ash actions authorized as that member on the tenant plane, so a vault
  field read resolves to `%Masked{}` and no plaintext leaks (INV-1).

  ## T40 additions (record-mutation + webhook actions)

  T39 shipped the fields the `notify` action needed. T40's record-mutation family
  (`mutate_record` update mode, `assign_owner`, `add_tag`) needs to locate and
  re-fetch the SUBJECT record itself, and the `webhook` action needs the
  workflow's signing secret and the triggering event's id (for a stable
  `delivery_id`) — none of which `notify` ever touched. Four fields are added,
  all optional/additive (a struct match on `%Context{}` is unaffected; `Notify`
  ignores them):

    * `:resource_key` — the trigger's target resource module string (mirrors the
      envelope field `Samen.Automation.RunWorker` already reads to build the
      eligible-only `subject` map — now threaded onto the struct too).
    * `:record_id` — the subject record's id (nil for a schedule/manual trigger
      with no chosen record).
    * `:event_id` — the envelope's event id (nil for schedule/manual).
    * `:webhook_secret` — the workflow's per-row HMAC secret (ADR-039 §5.3), read
      once by `RunWorker` from the Workflow row — never re-fetched by the action,
      never logged, never placed in any outcome meta.

  ## A3 addition (ADR-047 §5.1): `:origin`

  An AGENT tool call also fires a governed action, but an agent run is not a
  workflow — stuffing a run id into `:workflow_id` would be a lie the Health
  surface then renders. One optional, additive field carries the provenance
  instead (exactly as T40 added four optional fields without breaking any
  `%Context{}` match):

    * `:origin` — `{:workflow, workflow_id}` | `{:agent, run_id}` | `nil` (a
      pre-A3 workflow context). `:workflow_id` is nil-able ONLY when `origin` is
      `{:agent, _}`, and the ONE site constructing an agent-origin context is
      `Samen.AI.Agent.Context.build/2` — the workflow pipeline never sets it.

defmodule Samen.Automation.Action do
  @moduledoc """
  The E2 action behaviour (ADR-039 §5.1). T39 ships the behaviour + the single
  `Samen.Automation.Notify` action (the minimal end-to-end proof); T40 fills the
  remaining seven and the webhook egress contract. T40 plugs in by adding modules
  to the registry — the pipeline (capture → dispatch → run → compile) never changes.

  ## The three faces

    * `kind/0` — the bounded registry string key.
    * `validate/2` — WRITE-time config validation, called by the Workflow changeset
      ALONGSIDE `Samen.Automation.NonPiiPredicates` (bad configs refused at save,
      never at fire time). Interpolations that reference a subject attribute must
      reference a **condition-eligible** one — the same oracle gate (ADR-039 §5.2).
    * `run/2` — fire time. Returns `{:ok, meta}` (bounded ids/enums only — lands in
      the Run outcome) or `{:error, error_kind}`. An action error NEVER crashes the
      engine (ADR-039 §5.1): the run finalizes `:failed`, completed steps compensate.
    * `undo/3` — optional Reactor compensation face (ADR-037 §5.7).

  ## The two AGENT-TOOL faces (ADR-047 §5.1, batch A3 — both fail-closed by default)

    * `tool_schema/0` — the EXPLICIT per-action agent-tool opt-in. An action that does
      not export it (or returns `:not_a_tool`) is **not a tool**: it can never be
      offered to, or called by, a `Samen.AI.Agent` run, no matter what an agent
      definition declares. A returned schema MUST be a compile-time constant of the
      action module (a bounded `%{name:, description:, params: [...]}` map — never
      derived from tenant data; ADR-047 §4.2's static-schema rule, enforced at the
      chokepoint by the registered-static-def membership check and structurally by
      `mix samen.verify.ai_prompt_masking` check (d) at A7).
    * `effect/0` — `:read | :write`. An action that does not declare is `:write`
      (approval-gated through E3, ADR-047 §5.3) — forgetting to declare parks an
      action under the approval gate rather than executing it autonomously. Batch A3
      executes ONLY `effect: :read` tools inline; `:write` tools propose via
      `Samen.Approvals.Gate` at A4.

    * `tool_surfaces/0` — the SURFACE opt-in (T183; ADR-047 §5.1a, PROPOSED). Which of
      `Samen.AI.ToolSurface.action_surfaces/0`'s scopes may invoke this tool. Read
      through `Samen.AI.ToolSurface.surfaces_for/1`, which also owns the closed set, so
      this module keeps no second copy of it. An action that declares NOTHING is on
      `[:tenant]` only — the one lane it already ran on before T183, so nothing widens;
      `:ci_eval` is opt-in, and `:mcp` is not declarable here at all (that registry
      belongs to `Samen.AI.Mcp`, the only module that can dispatch it). A MALFORMED
      declaration is refused whole and lands the action on no surface.

  **No shipped action becomes a tool by accident**: the 8 ADR-039 kinds export
  NEITHER callback, so all 8 are `:not_a_tool` (and would be `:write` even if opted
  in). The only opted-in tools are A3's two read-effect actions and A4's ONE
  write-effect action below — every one an explicit, reviewed edit to a module.

  A4's `assign_record_owner` is `effect: :write`: `Samen.AI.Agent` never invokes its
  `run/2` from a turn. The turn opens an E3 approval and the run parks; a distinct human's
  approve is the only thing that executes it, with the APPROVER's actor (ADR-043 §6.2,
  unamended — ADR-047 §5.3).
