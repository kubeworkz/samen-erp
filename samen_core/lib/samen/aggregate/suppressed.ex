defmodule Samen.Aggregate.Suppressed do
  @moduledoc """
  `%Suppressed{}` — the **aggregate cell's fail-closed value** when a privacy floor
  fires (T4.5 clauses (a)+(b); doc §control ∴ block + the "Token-blind isn't
  inference-blind" honest edge).

  > the aggregate plane enforces today a minimum-cohort and minimum-distinct floor
  > (k-anonymity + l-diversity) …

  This is the direct analogue of `Samen.Masked` for the OUTPUT-privacy half of the
  two-plane story. Where `%Masked{}` is the vault field's normal value on the tenant
  plane (input privacy — a subject's PII never renders unless a grant reveals it),
  `%Suppressed{}` is an aggregate cell's value when its cohort is **too small
  (k-anonymity) or too homogeneous (l-diversity)** to release without re-identifying
  a subject.

  A `Suppressed` value carries only the *reason* the cell was withheld (`:k_anonymity`,
  `:l_diversity`, or `:query_budget`) and the floor's parameters (`k` / `l` and the
  observed cohort metric, or the budget `limit` / observed `count`) — it **never carries
  the underlying value**. There is therefore no value to leak by any serialization path.
  Rendering is `"⊘"` (the "suppressed" glyph) everywhere:

    - `String.Chars` (`to_string/1`, interpolation) → `"⊘"`
    - `Inspect` (`inspect/1`, logger `~p`) → `#Suppressed<k_anonymity ⊘>`
    - `Jason.Encoder` (JSON API / webhook payloads) → `{"suppressed": true, "reason": …}`

  ## Why a struct, not `nil` / `0`

  Returning `nil` or `0` for a suppressed cell is a leak by another name: a caller
  differencing two near-identical cohorts (the differencing attack the doc names)
  learns that a cell *dropped below the floor* — and `0` is indistinguishable from a
  real zero-count, which itself can be re-identifying. A distinct sentinel makes the
  suppression **explicit and inspectable** (a dashboard renders "⊘ suppressed" and can
  explain why) while never exposing the count-of-one value that triggered it. The
  observed metric it carries (`observed`) is the cohort SIZE that fell below `k`, or
  the DISTINCT-COUNT that fell below `l` — surfacing *that a floor fired* is the point
  of the honest posture; it is not the sensitive value itself.

  Fail closed: a cell is suppressed by REPLACING its value, so a serialization path
  that forgot about suppression (a raw `Jason.encode!`, a CSV row) still cannot emit
  the withheld number — it structurally isn't in the struct.

  A query-budget suppression (T6.6 — the ENFORCING budget). The cohort's read count
  within the rolling window reached the per-cohort budget `limit`, so further aggregate
  reads on this cohort are DENIED (suppressed). `observed` is the read count at the point
  the budget was hit.

  This is the cross-query defence promoted from accounting-only (T4.5) to enforcing
  (T6.6): keyed per-COHORT (not per-actor — the doc names per-actor as the wrong unit
  against collusion), so two colluding actors querying the same cohort hit the SAME
  budget. Unlike the k-anon / l-diversity FLOORS (which bound a SINGLE query's output),
  this bounds the NUMBER of queries against a cohort over time — the differencing /
  repeated-overlap defence.

  Honest caveat (see `Samen.Aggregate.QueryBudget` moduledoc): the budget is a coarse,
  deterministic cross-query control. It stops repeated hammering of a cohort; it does not
  give a formal differential-privacy composition guarantee. That formal guarantee (an
  epsilon-budget composed across queries) remains posture under construction.
