defmodule Samen.Aggregate.Extension do
  @moduledoc """
  Spark DSL extension that MARKS a resource as belonging to the token-blind
  aggregate plane and wires the compile-time `NoPiiColumns` verifier (C7; T4.2
  clause (b)).

  A resource declared with `use Samen.Aggregate.Resource` carries this extension.
  Two things follow:

    1. **Marker** — it persists `aggregate_plane: true` (readable via
       `Samen.Aggregate.Info.aggregate_plane?/1`), so the whole-app mix-task
       backstop (`mix samen.verify.no_pii_columns`) and the aggregate domain can
       tell aggregate resources from tenant/operator resources.

    2. **Enforcement** — the "no pii_ columns at all" rule runs at COMPILE time on
       this resource ONLY (it is in THIS extension's lists, never the base
       `Samen.Extension`'s), so it can never false-positive on a tenant-plane
       resource — only a resource that opted INTO the aggregate plane is held to the
       rule. It fails compile if the resource declares a `pii_attribute`, a vault, a
       `pii_`-shaped column, or a relationship reaching a PII-bearing resource. Two
       modules share ONE rule set (`Samen.Verifiers.NoPiiColumns.violations/2`):

         * `Samen.Aggregate.NoPiiTransformer` — the HARD ABORT. Returns
           `{:error, DslError}`, which reliably aborts `Code.compile_string` in this
           Ash/Spark version (a verifier raise does not — it is defense-in-depth,
           per the T1.3 note). This is what makes the compile-time guarantee
           fail-closed.
         * `Samen.Verifiers.NoPiiColumns` — the named C7 verifier: introspection +
           the per-resource diagnostic + the shared rule source the whole-app
           `mix samen.verify.no_pii_columns` backstop reuses.

  This extension carries no DSL sections of its own — the marker is a persisted key
  set by `Samen.Aggregate.MarkTransformer`; the transformer/verifier read the
  resource's attributes/relationships/`pii do` block directly.

  Is this aggregate-plane resource an **org-scoped** projection (P17 / ADR-045 §3)?

  The token-blind cross-tenant aggregate plane (`Samen.Aggregate.read_all/2`,
  `Samen.Policy.AggregateActorOnly`, org-less `Samen.Aggregate.Actor`) is org-LESS by
  construction. P17 is the SEPARATE, org-scoped sibling: a `use Samen.Aggregate.Resource`
  projection that carries a NON-NULL `org_id` partition, guards reads with
  `Samen.Policy.OrgScope`, and is read by the tenant's OWN org actor via
  `Samen.Aggregate.read_all_for_org/3` — NOT by relaxing T144 or the cross-tenant gate.

  A resource opts in by defining `org_scoped_aggregate?/0` returning `true` (the same
  zero-DSL convention `aggregate_cohort_spec/0` uses). The org-scoped arm of
  `mix samen.verify.aggregate_privacy` then holds it to the extra invariant that its
  `org_id` attribute is a real partition (`allow_nil?: false`) — the C7 `NoPiiColumns`
  refusal and the fail-closed cohort spec apply to EVERY aggregate resource already.
