defmodule Samen.AbbrevRegistry do
  @moduledoc """
  The **abbrev registry**: a committed, permanent record mapping every 3-letter
  storage abbrev to the resource module that owns it (A5 in the plan; doc
  §"Self-qualifying storage" — "no rename drift"; memory: "permanent/never-recycled
  like a ticker").

  ## Why a committed file

  A resource's abbrev is projected into the DB column names, CDC rows, logs, and
  catalog. Once data exists under `com_name`, that prefix can never change without
  rewriting history — so abbrevs are treated exactly like stock tickers:
  **permanent, never recycled, one owner forever.** The registry is the durable
  source of truth for that invariant, committed to the repo (`priv/abbrev_registry.json`)
  and checked at compile time by `Samen.Verifiers.AbbrevRegistry`.

  ## Format

  The **legacy / global** namespace (the shape the committed file uses today, 263
  entries) is a flat `"abbrevs"` map — this is the cross-host collision net:

      {
        "abbrevs": {
          "com": "MyApp.Crm.Contact",
          "cpy": "MyApp.Crm.Company"
        }
      }

  Keys are abbrevs (3-letter lowercase); values are the owning resource module's
  fully-qualified name.

  ## Host-namespaced schema (ADR-023, ADR-006 Option B)

  The schema optionally gains a `"hosts"` object keying `(host, abbrev) → owner`, so
  two *different* apps may legitimately own the same physical 3-letter prefix (e.g.
  `demo`'s `cmp` and `driftwood`'s `cmp` are distinct, both permanently owned):

      {
        "abbrevs": { … the global cross-host net … },
        "hosts": {
          "widgetco": { "wid": "Widgetco.Vertical.Widget" }
        }
      }

  The `"hosts"` key is **optional** — a file without one reads byte-identically to the
  legacy shape (the committed registry now HAS a `"hosts"` object — see ADR-025 §5 — so
  this optionality is about the *schema*, not the current committed file). `load/0`
  returns the **flat global view** (the union of `"abbrevs"` and every host namespace) so
  the compile-time verifier and every existing reader keep working unchanged (the compat
  shim). Host-scoped reads/writes go through `load_namespaced/1`, `owner/2`, and
  `validate_host/4`.

  ## Bounded scope (ADR-023 §2 / §4)

  WS-D D8 lands the **allocator** (`mix samen.abbrev.reserve`) + the **host-namespaced
  schema it writes** + this **read-compat shim**. Fully partitioning the compile-time
  verifier (`Samen.Verifiers.AbbrevRegistry`) + every reader to be host-aware is a
  50+ file change (ADR-006 §3) and ships as the phased follow-on ADR-025 — the verifier
  still reads the flattened global view here, which is correct **while the flattening is
  lossless**. `"hosts"` is no longer empty in-tree — it carries a handful of
  non-conflicting host allocations (the F3 consent-ledger abbrevs, one per host, all
  distinct) — but every host abbrev still resolves to exactly one owner across all
  namespaces, so the flat union equals the intended view. A fail-closed **tripwire** now
  enforces that invariant: `flatten_conflicts/1` detects any abbrev owned by two
  namespaces with different owners, and `load/0` RAISES (naming ADR-025) the day a real
  cross-host prefix reuse lands — turning ADR-025's latent risk into a loud,
  self-enforcing gate rather than a silent false-positive.

  ## Invariants enforced by the verifier

    * every abbrev is **3-letter lowercase** (`^[a-z]{3}$`);
    * **no collision** — two resources may not claim the same abbrev;
    * **no rename** — a resource may not change the abbrev it is registered under;
    * **registered** — a resource whose abbrev is missing from the registry fails
      compile (you must commit the registry entry to permanently reserve it).

  Removing/recycling is prevented by the same rules: the registry is append-mostly,
  and an abbrev listed for resource A cannot be handed to resource B.

  Detects a **lossy flattening** in a namespaced registry — the ADR-025 tripwire

  Returns the list of abbrevs whose flattened owner is **ambiguous**: the SAME abbrev

  lossy cases exactly:

    * **(a) cross-host reuse** — two hosts own the same abbrev for distinct resources; and

  deferred host-partition (ADR-025) must now land. Same-owner reuse of an abbrev across
  namespaces is NOT a conflict (flattening is lossless), so it is not reported.

      `allow_cross_host_reuse: true` (see below).

  Returns `:ok` when the abbrev is unowned, or already owned by exactly this owner in ANY
  host (idempotent re-reservation — own-host OR cross-host same-owner).

  ## T123 — accidental cross-host collision refused by default (the persistence path)

  Before T123 this checked only the *target* host's namespace + the global net, never any
  OTHER host's namespace — so `Samen.Abbrev.Allocator.reserve!/5` (the sanctioned write
  path routing through here) would persist `hosts.A.xyz` alongside a pre-existing
  `hosts.B.xyz` owned by a DIFFERENT module. That orphan is exactly the T47 incident: it
  trips `flatten_conflicts/1`'s fail-closed "LOSSY FLATTENING" raise inside every
  `use Samen.Resource`, breaking the whole compile. `propose/3` never auto-picks such a
  collision (its `owners_of/2` union check); this makes the *explicit-abbrev* / persistence
  path just as safe — an accidental different-owner cross-host reservation is refused at
  WRITE time, not deferred to a compile-break.

  ### The deliberate ADR-025 Option-B door (explicit override)

  A *legitimate* cross-host prefix reuse (two hosts deliberately owning the same abbrev for
  distinct resources — "the whole point of Option B", ADR-025 §2) is still possible, but
  ONLY when the caller opts in explicitly with `allow_cross_host_reuse: true`. Because
  `validate_host/5` cannot tell a sanctioned reuse from an accident, the default is
  fail-closed and the human must say so. A deliberate reuse then (correctly) trips
  `flatten_conflicts/1` at load — the ADR-025 trigger to implement the verifier
  host-partition, not an accident.
