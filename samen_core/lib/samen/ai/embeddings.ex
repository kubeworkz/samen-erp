defmodule Samen.AI.Embeddings do
  @moduledoc """
  The D3 semantic-search plane (ADR-043 §7, T67) — embed-on-write + vector similarity search
  over the org-scoped `aie_embedding` store, keyless in CI and deny-by-default by construction.

  ## The three guarantees this module is responsible for

    1. **Deny-by-default embedding (§7.2).** `embed_record/4` embeds ONLY the fields a resource
       DECLARES embeddable (`embeddable_fields/0`, the `samen` section seam). A vault-routed
       (🔒) field is refused at THREE layers — it fails compile if declared embeddable
       (`Samen.Verifiers.EmbeddableNoPii`), the `ai_prompt_masking` verifier flags it in ci.sh,
       and here `embed_field/6` re-refuses `{:error, :field_not_embeddable}` for any field not
       in the declared allowlist OR that is vault-routed. And every embed input is sealed by
       `Samen.AI.Chokepoint` (`:embed`), whose fail-closed scrub refuses a `%Samen.Masked{}` /
       `vt_*`-bearing value outright — so even if all the above were bypassed, a vaulted value
       cannot reach the embedder or the vector store (`{:error, :pii_egress_refused}`). Grants
       NEVER unlock embedding: a vector persists beyond any grant window and is invertible.

    2. **Org isolation (§7.3).** Every row carries `aie_org_id`; every read/write filters on the
       calling scope's `org_id`. Org B's vectors are never returned — never even *ranked* — for
       org A. A scope with no org is refused fail-closed (`{:error, :no_org}`), the
       `Samen.Scope.new/1` cross-org-hazard posture.

    3. **Keyless, fail-honest (§4, M9).** The embedder resolves to
       `Samen.AI.Embedder.Deterministic` when unwired in `:test` (deterministic ⇒ ranking-shape
       and org-scoping tests are REAL); unwired elsewhere ⇒ `{:error, :not_configured}` (never a
       faked vector). A host wires a real embeddings provider via
       `config :samen_core, Samen.AI, embedder: {Module, config}`.

       > **Keyless ranking is by HASH distance, not meaning (T152, honest framing).** The
       > deterministic embedder is a stable bag-of-tokens hash projection — a self-query lands
       > at distance 0 and shared tokens rank nearer, but there is NO semantic quality
       > (synonyms/paraphrase do not rank closer). Meaningful semantic ranking needs a LIVE
       > embedder (wire one + `SAMEN_AI_LIVE=1`). This is the inherent keyless limitation, not
       > a bug — see `Samen.AI.Embedder.Deterministic` and `docs/guides/ai-quickstart.md`.

  ## Routes through the chokepoint (never a raw embedder call)

  `embed_field/6` seals its input via `Samen.AI.Chokepoint.embed/4` — the ONE
  provider-invocation site — so the masking/refusal pipeline runs before a byte is embedded or
  stored. This module never calls an embedder's `embed/2` directly.

  ## Storage is a plain-Ecto derived index (not an Ash resource)

  `aie_embedding` is kernel infrastructure (the `Samen.Reveal.RevealGrant` / `Samen.AuditEvent`
  precedent), so it carries no allocator abbrev and org-scoping is enforced in the query builder
  (a hard `WHERE aie_org_id = $org`) rather than an `OrgScope` policy — functionally identical
  for a derived index, and proven by the cross-org red test. The `pgvector` `<->` L2 distance
  ranks; the HNSW index (§7.1) accelerates it.
