  `Samen.AI.Agent` — the first-party multi-turn agent loop over `Samen.AI.complete/4`
  (ADR-047 §3/§4/§6; batch A1: the loop core; batch A2: durability + erasure; batch A3:
  the read-tool surface + EG2 scrubbing).

  ## The declared policy seam (T181, §10a row 25)

  Every policy this loop applies used to be loop-internal and unextendable. It now has
  exactly ONE declared seam — `Samen.AI.Agent.Hook`'s seven-point ordered chain, dispatched
  by `Samen.AI.Agent.Hooks` — resolved once per run (host config, then the per-run `:hooks`
  opt) and threaded on `opts` as `:resolved_hooks` beside `:resolved_tools`. Six of the
  seven points have call sites here (`:session_start`, `:before_completion`,
  `:after_tool_request`, `:before_tool_call`, `:after_tool_execution`, `:on_error`);
  `:after_compaction` is declared and dispatchable but has no caller, because this loop
  performs no transcript compaction in v1.

  **First-decision-wins**, and hooks may only NARROW: a `{:block, reason}` is the fail-honest
  refusal turn `:hook_blocked`, a `{:halt, reason}` is a real terminal `:hook_halted`
  (never a promoted answer), an `{:edit, call}` may not change WHICH tool runs and its args
  re-run `refuse_vt_args/1` plus the action's own `validate/2` before anything is stamped
  or executed, and no hook return approves a write — an `effect: :write` tool still parks
  for a distinct human (ADR-043 §6.2, unamended). A hook that RAISES fails the call closed
  (`:hook_error`), never letting it execute unhooked. `egress_opts/3`'s allowlist is
  untouched, so no hook can re-enable grant plaintext on the agent path.

  ## What A4 adds — the WRITE surface, via approval only (ADR-047 §5.3)

  ADR-043 §6.2 — *"AI writes do not exist … anything with side effects goes through the
  E3 approvals engine"* — was ratified **unamended** for this loop (§9#1), and A4 is where
  that stops being a promise. An `effect: :write` tool passes the same four-way
  intersection a read tool passes, and that admission buys it a **proposal, not an
  execution**: the turn stamps its decision (tool kind + arg key names + the sha256
  args digest) on the still-`:proposed` `{run_id, turn_index}` row, opens an E3 approval
  through `Samen.AI.Agent.WriteProposal` with the AI service principal as requester, and
  the run **parks `:awaiting_approval`** — non-terminal, watchdog armed to the deadline,
  cursor NOT advanced, `tool_calls_used` NOT billed. `entry.module.run/2` is never called
  on that path.

  A DISTINCT human's approve is the only thing that executes it, and `execute_approved/3`
  runs the governed action **as the APPROVER** — never the agent, never the AI principal,
  which holds no write authority anywhere (§10a row 7). Before it fires, `bind_proposal/3`
  requires the proposal recovered from the run's DEK envelope to agree, field by field,
  with the token-only stamp committed before the human ever saw it: **approving proposal X
  executes exactly X**, and a mutated or substituted payload refuses `:proposal_mismatch`,
  rolling the whole decision back. The four-way intersection, `validate/2` and the `vt_`
  arg gate all re-run at execution — nothing is trusted from proposal time. A rejection
  terminates the run `:rejected`, honestly, having executed nothing.

  The §5.1 **recursion guard is live**: an AMBIENT provenance marker is published around
  every tool execution (inline reads and approved writes alike), so an action that starts
  an agent run is refused `:depth_exceeded` whether or not it passes a `:depth` argument.
  v1 admits no nesting (`max_agent_depth/0 == 0`).

  ## What A3 adds — governed tools (ADR-047 §4.2/§4.3/§5.1)

  A definition's `tools:` list now RESOLVES through the five-way narrowing intersection
  (`Samen.AI.Agent.Tools`: registry ∩ per-action `tool_schema/0` opt-in ∩ the T183
  SURFACE scope ∩ the declared list ∩ the owner actor's policy envelope at execution)
  — at run START (arms 1-3, fail-closed refusals persist nothing) and again PER CALL.
  One tool call per turn:
  native `%Completion{tool_calls:}` first, else the bounded `TOOL: {"tool": _, "args":
  _}` JSON envelope (`parse_next/1` — the A1 `FINAL:` grammar grown per §10). The EG2
  story hop-by-hop: tool DEFS ride the sealed payload's `:tools` field (compile-time
  static, chokepoint-scrubbed + static-membership-checked); model ARGS are vt_-scanned
  and validated by the action's own `validate/2` BEFORE execution; the governed action
  runs AS the owner actor (`Samen.AI.Agent.Context.build/2` — honest refusals recorded,
  never silent skips); the call ECHO + RESULT re-enter ONLY as
  `Samen.AI.Agent.ToolResult` rendered, PiiResolution-EGRESS-resolved binaries through
  the vault-routed transcript → `:history` (per-turn §3.2a re-scrub; `safe_segment?/1`
  fail-closed last line; vault-routed result fields render `••••` always — §9#2). The
  `{run_id, turn_index}` turn row gains the tool DECISION stamp (kind + arg key names +
  validated-args digest) committed before the tool fires; `tool_calls_used` now counts
  for real and `max_tool_calls` exhaustion is live. `effect: :write` tools PROPOSE
  instead of executing (A4, above) — A3's interim `:tools_not_supported` refusal is gone,
  replaced by a real door rather than a wider one.

  ## What A2 adds to the A1 loop

  The same turn engine now runs in **two modes over one durable cursor**:

    * `run/4` — A1's synchronous mode, unchanged in contract: execute to a terminal
      state in the calling process (tests, inline hosts);
    * `start/4` + `Samen.AI.Agent.TurnWorker` — the durable mode (ADR-047 §4.1(c)):
      the run row is created `:queued` and the FIRST worker job is enqueued via
      `Oban.insert` **inside the create's own transaction** (the
      `Samen.Automation.EventCapture` idiom — the job exists iff the row committed).
      The worker executes turns in batches of `turns_per_job/0` (default 4) and
      re-arms itself; the AshOban `:agent_turn_due` due-scan (on `Samen.AI.Agent.Run`)
      is the watchdog that recovers ANY lost job. `next_turn_at` is **never nil while
      the run is non-terminal** (the `Samen.Sequences` invariant), so a stalled run is
      always re-selectable. The run row is the SINGLE retry authority — the worker
      returns `:ok` to Oban for every business outcome (Sequences' rule).

  **Restart safety / turn-row replay (RP-AG-7).** Every turn writes two checkpoints:
  the **decision** — a `{run_id, turn_index}` `Samen.AI.Agent.Turn` row committed
  `:proposed` BEFORE the slow provider call — and the **outcome** — that same row
  finalized `:done`/`:failed` **in one DB transaction with the run-cursor advance**
  (so a `:done` row and the cursor can never disagree). A worker death mid-turn is
  recovered by the watchdog; the replay FINDS the existing `:proposed` row and REUSES
  it (`find_or_reuse_turn/3`, stamped `meta: %{"replayed" => true}`) — the
  `Samen.Sequences.find_or_create_step_send/2` row-reuse shape, and from A3 the reason
  a tool fires at most once per turn row. Posture stated plainly, as Sequences states
  it: **at-least-once, never claimed exactly-once** — the provider call between the
  two checkpoints can genuinely repeat; the turn row does not.

  ## The vault-routed transcript (A2 — §7.4; §9#2/#4 TAKEN)

  The run's accumulated history no longer lives in the executing process: goal + the
  rendered assistant lines persist as the run row's vault-routed `:transcript`
  (JSON `{"goal": _, "lines": [...]}`), inside the DEK envelope keyed on the run's own
  id. The engine reveals it at each turn boundary through the ONE decrypt chokepoint
  (`Samen.Vault.reveal/3`, bound `subject_id: run.id` — the `Samen.Identity.Totp`
  precedent) and threads the lines as `:history`, so `Samen.AI.Chokepoint`'s §3.2a
  re-scrub + step-3/4 allowlist scrub still run over EVERY prior line on EVERY turn.
  A shredded/unavailable transcript is a fail-honest terminal
  (`:transcript_unavailable`) — an erased run can never keep executing on cached text.
  Grant plaintext stays categorically excluded (`egress_opts/2` pins
  `grant_egress?: false` LAST; §4.4).

  ## Breakers + kill-switch (A2 — §6; `Samen.AI.Agent.Breaker`)

  `run/4` and `start/4` refuse at run start — and the loop re-checks the operator
  kill-switch at EVERY turn boundary (never only at run start — the
  `Automation.RunWorker` "already-queued half" lesson; sabotage 244's target):

    * host kill-switch ON ⇒ `{:error, :killed}` (fail-closed; in-flight runs stop at
      the next boundary, terminal `:failed`/`"killed"`);
    * the ratified 60-runs-per-org-hour rate trip (§9#3) — counted from the run log
      itself, no second counter; crossing it trips the SAME kill the operator uses,
      reason `:rate_tripped`, and re-arming is explicit-operator-only;
    * consecutive normalized provider errors park the agent definition
      (`{:error, :provider_tripped}`) rather than burning budget through an outage.

  ## Fail-honest budgets (§6; §9#3 TAKEN — the floor is NON-configurable)

  Five budgets per run, checked at EVERY turn boundary (`over_budget/2`) alongside the
  durable cancel flag and the kill-switch. Exhaustion is a terminal `:budget_exhausted`
  with a bounded `error_kind` — **the last assistant turn is NEVER promoted to an
  answer** (RP-AG-6; sabotage 240). Token budgets are deliberately soft by up to ONE
  turn (`over_budget/2` uses `>` on the summed counters — the turn that crosses the
  ceiling completes and is billed; the NEXT turn is refused); the breaker assumes soft
  ceilings and never treats the overshoot as a violation.

  ## Token-only observability (EG6, §6)

  The run row, the turn rows, and the one terminal `Logger` line carry ids, enums,
  counts, and durations only — no prompt text, no completion text, ever (the ONE text
  artifact is the vault-routed transcript above). `safe_error_kind/1` is the
  closed-enum degrade; `bounded_meta/1` is the map twin (the
  `RunRecord.bounded_outcomes/1` posture).

  ## Defining an agent

      defmodule MyApp.TriageAgent do

          goal_prompt: "Work the goal step by step. Reply FINAL: <answer> when done.",
          budgets: [max_turns: 4]
      end

      {:ok, %{answer: answer, run: run}} =
        Samen.AI.Agent.run(MyApp.TriageAgent, scope, "Why is shipment 4471 late?")

  The `use` macro validates the definition at compile time (name shape, `vt_`-free goal
  prompt — the EG5 authored-artifact posture, budget shape) and defines `definition/0`.

  # ADR-047 §5.1 recursion guard, LIVE (A4). "An agent tool may not start another agent
  # run at `depth > 0` in v1" — read literally and conservatively: an agent run at depth
  # > 0 may not be started AT ALL, so v1 admits no nesting. The guard is AMBIENT (a
  # process-scoped provenance marker set around every tool execution, including the
  # APPROVED write execution) rather than a `:depth` argument, precisely so an action
  # cannot route around it by calling `run/4`/`start/4` without one. An explicit
  # `:depth`/`:chain` opt is checked too; the ambient marker wins.
  #
  # NAMED RESIDUAL — a RAW `spawn/1` still escapes, and closing it is A7's job
  # (A6; the A5 verifier's R-A5-1). A5 made the marker follow `$callers`/`$ancestors`,
  # which closes the ORDINARY-concurrency class (`Task.async`, `Task.Supervisor`, a task
  # of a task, a supervised child) — verified live. A bare `spawn/1` sets NEITHER, so a
  # first-party action module whose `run/2` did its work there and called `start/4` from
  # the child would persist a fresh TOP-LEVEL run at `depth: 0, chain: []`. A6 examined
  # every DYNAMIC closure and rejected each as disproportionate or actively harmful:
  #
  #   * any process-scoped mechanism (dictionary, ambient marker, logger metadata) is
  #     defeated by the same primitive that defeats this one — it is the primitive's
  #     defining property that it inherits nothing;
  #   * a DURABLE in-flight arm — "refuse a start whose caller chain is unresolvable
  #     while this {org, definition} has a tool execution in flight" — is the only
  #     runtime signal a raw-spawned child shares with its parent, and it REFUSES
  #     LEGITIMATE CONCURRENCY: two humans starting the same triage definition in the
  #     same org at the same time is ordinary, and the second start would be refused
  #     because the first is mid-tool. Trading a real availability bug for a
  #     defence-in-depth one is a bad trade, and the ADR's own instruction is not to
  #     ship a half-measure that breaks legitimate concurrency;
  #   * stamping the run/turn row does not help either: the child cannot be ATTRIBUTED
  #     to the parent run without the caller chain the raw spawn destroyed, so the
  #     stamp could only be consulted by {org, definition} — which is the same
  #     concurrency-breaking arm above, wearing a schema change.
  #
  # The escape's reachability class is unchanged from A4's R3: only a FIRST-PARTY /
  # host-authored action module can author the spawn (tenant data never becomes code),
  # so this is defence-in-depth, not a tenant-reachable path. The sound closure is
  # therefore STATIC, not dynamic: `mix samen.verify.agent_coverage` (A7, §9#6) must
  # assert by AST that no `tool_schema/0`-exporting module calls `Samen.AI.Agent.start/4`
  # or `run/4` at all — which refuses the escape at compile/gate time regardless of
  # which spawn primitive the module would have used, and costs no concurrency. Recorded
  # as ADR-047 §10a row 19 and carried as an explicit A7 obligation.

  # The tool turn (A3 — ADR-047 §4.3/§5.1)

  # One model-chosen tool call. Order is load-bearing:
  #   1. AUTHORIZE — the four-way intersection re-check (arms 1-3 via the run's RESOLVED
  #      set; sabotage 249's target) + the vt_-sentinel arg gate + the action's own
  #      write-time validate/2. Any refusal is an HONEST feedback turn (recorded on the
  #      turn row + a bounded line the model sees) — never a silent skip, never an
  #      execution;
  #   2. DECIDE — stamp tool_kind + arg key names + the validated-args sha256 digest onto
  #      the :proposed turn row (ADR-047 §4.1 checkpoint 1's tool half), committed BEFORE
  #      the governed action fires — the {run_id, turn_index} row is the tool-idempotency
  #      key a replay reuses;
  #   3. EXECUTE — the governed action runs AS the owner actor (arm 4: the actor's real
  #      policy envelope binds inside the action's own Ash reads; INV-2);
  #   4. RENDER + COMMIT — the call echo + result re-enter ONLY as ToolResult-rendered,
  #      PiiResolution-egress-resolved binaries appended to the vault-routed transcript
  #      (they re-enter as :history next turn — §3.2a re-scrub + safe_segment?/1 last
  #      line), finalized atomically with the cursor advance + tool_calls_used counter.
  #
  # T181 threads the declared hook seam through steps 1-3: `:after_tool_request` sees the
  # RAW model request before the intersection resolves it, `:before_tool_call` sees the
  # already-validated call and may block, edit, or halt it, and `:after_tool_execution`
  # sees the outcome before it is committed. An edit re-runs the WHOLE arg gate.

  # `:proposed` `{run_id, turn_index}` turn row (so a replay proposes ONCE — the engine's
  # own `{org_id, kind, subject_ref}` pending-idempotency), the model's call ECHO plus a
  # bounded "proposed" line join the vault-routed transcript, and the run parks
  # `:awaiting_approval` with `next_turn_at` armed to the approval deadline (non-nil —
  # the run is NOT terminal). The proposed ARGS ride the transcript, i.e. inside the DEK
  # envelope; the approval row and the turn row hold only tokens.
  #
  # An approvals engine that cannot open the approval (unwired host, unregistered kind,
  # write failure) is a fail-honest `:approval_unavailable` feedback turn — the run keeps
  # going under its budgets and NOTHING is executed. The failure mode of a broken
  # approvals seam is "the agent cannot propose", never "the agent just did it".

  Execute an APPROVED write proposal — called ONLY by `Samen.AI.Agent.WriteProposal`'s
  `on_approve/2`, INSIDE the E3 decision transaction, after the engine has already
  refused `decided_by == requested_by` at both the policy and DB-CHECK layers.

  **The approval itself is verified from the DATABASE, not from the argument.** The struct
  handed in is caller-supplied — this function is public because the E3 handler lives in
  its own module — and its `id` is the only field an attacker needs, which is exactly the
  field that sits in the PLAIN `atn_meta.approval_id` column next to the proposal. So
  `verify_approval/4` re-loads the row through the engine and requires it to be a real,
  `:approved`-state approval, in the RUN's org, of this module's kind, hanging on THIS
  turn's `subject_ref`, decided by a distinct party who is the actor now executing. A
  forged map, a still-`pending` row, a rejected/cancelled row, or another org's approval
  all refuse fail-closed — so the execution can never outrun the state transition that
  makes the decision real and writes its audit event.

  Three properties are load-bearing here, and each has its own sabotage:

    * **the approval of proposal X executes exactly X** — `bind_proposal/3` re-derives the
      proposal from the vault-routed transcript and requires it to agree, field by field,
      with the token-only stamp committed on the turn row BEFORE the approval was opened:
      the sha256 args digest recomputed over the stored args, the digest recorded in the
      proposal, the tool kind, the arg key names, the turn index, and the approval id. A
      payload mutated or substituted between proposal and approval — in either store —
      refuses `:proposal_mismatch`, which rolls the whole decision back;
    * **only an APPROVED approval executes** — `verify_approval/4` (above); sabotage 256
      drops the state guard and a still-`pending` approval executes the parked write with
      no decision transition and no `approval_approved` audit event;
    * **execution carries the APPROVER's authority, never the agent's** — the governed
      action runs as a principal built from the DECIDING actor. The AI service principal
      that requested it holds no write authority on this path (or any other), which is
      what makes ADR-043 §6.2 ("AI writes do not exist") structurally true rather than
      procedurally hoped-for.

  The full four-way intersection is re-resolved here, not trusted from proposal time: a
  tool de-registered, de-opted-in, or de-declared while the approval sat pending refuses
  `:tool_refused`. `validate/2` and the `vt_` arg gate run again too.

  Any `{:error, _}` rolls the decision back: the approval stays `pending`, the run stays
  parked, nothing executed, no audit lands.

  Expire a PARKED run whose approval deadline has lapsed (ADR-047 §5.3; the A4
  verifier's R4b, closed at A5).

  A4 parked a run on a human decision and set `next_turn_at` to the approval deadline,
  but nothing ever swept it: a lapsed proposal sat decidable forever, and the run was an
  unselectable in-flight state. `:awaiting_approval` is now swept by the
  `:agent_proposal_expiry` AshOban trigger, which drives this path.

  What expiry IS, precisely: the pending approval is **withdrawn** (via the requester's
  own `Samen.Approvals.cancel/3` — `decided_by` stays NULL, so the distinct-party CHECK
  is untouched and the audit trail never claims a human decided), the still-`:proposed`
  turn row is finalized `:failed` / `deadline_expired`, one bounded line is appended to
  the vault-routed transcript so a later reader sees WHY the run stopped, and the run
  lands in the honest terminal `:expired` with `next_turn_at` cleared (never-nil holds:
  the run is terminal). **The proposed write is never executed** — and cannot be, because
  `execute_approved/3` requires `run_parked?/1` AND a genuinely `:approved` approval row,
  and the withdrawal makes the second impossible while the terminal makes the first
  impossible.

  Public + idempotent so the sweep is directly drivable in a test (and by an operator
  surface) without waiting on a cron tick. A run that is not parked is a no-op.
