defmodule Samen.AI.Chokepoint do
  @moduledoc """
  THE single AI-egress chokepoint (ADR-043 §3; D2, T65 — the real masker; D1 seam was T64).
  This is the ONLY module in `samen_core`/`samen_web` that:

    1. **mints** a `%Samen.AI.MaskedPayload{}` (`seal/3` — the single-mint requirement,
       the `Samen.Files.ChokepointGuard` / `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint` single-path
       mirror), and
    2. **invokes** a `Samen.AI.Provider` callback (`complete/5` / `embed/4` route to
       `provider.complete/2` / `provider.embed/2`).

  Both properties are DETECTED at CI (not compile-time-impossible):
  `Samen.AI.ChokepointAntiBypassProbeTest` is an AST scan over every app's `lib/` asserting no
  module outside this file constructs a `%Samen.AI.MaskedPayload{}` by ANY form. This is a
  detection guarantee (`%MaskedPayload{}` is a plain struct, so it is not type-impossible to
  forge); the honest residual is runtime-computed metaprogramming, beyond static AST detection.

  ## INV-7 by construction — the masking pipeline (§3.2), fail-CLOSED

  `seal/3` is a fixed-order pipeline; every step fails closed. It produces a
  `%MaskedPayload{}` ONLY after masking ALL vault-routed (🔒) content, or REFUSES with
  `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}` (payload-free — EG6):

    1. **Resolve** (§3.2 step 1) — every `:bindings` entry (`{records, resource}`) is resolved
       through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` on the CALLER's actor in **egress mode**
       (`egress: true`): vault-routed fields come back `%Masked{}` (`••••`) on EVERY plane —
       masked-by-default (§6.1), stricter than the tenant UI. The ONE exception (INV-7's
       ephemeral clause): plaintext under a LIVE reveal grant AND the host opt-in
       `grant_plaintext_egress` (default off), admitted ONLY into a `:complete` payload —
       never `:embed`/`:mcp` (persisted/external egress; grants never apply). For `:embed`
       any vault-routed binding is REFUSED outright (deny-by-default, §7.2 — a vector persists
       beyond any grant window and is invertible; grants never unlock embedding).
    2. **Re-scrub history** (§3.2a) — `:history` (prior turns, INCLUDING prior assistant
       output) re-enters only here, re-resolved against the CURRENT turn's grant state. A
       grant-tagged span (`{:grant_span, text, %Samen.Reveal.Context{}}`) that the current
       turn no longer covers (grant lapsed/revoked, actor changed, or the flag now off)
       **re-masks to `••••` before assembly** — accumulated history cannot carry plaintext
       past its grant window into an ungranted turn. A grant-tagged span the current turn
       cannot VALIDATE is treated identically: a span whose context is not a
       `%Samen.Reveal.Context{}` (or whose grant checker raises) is un-re-checkable, so it
       re-masks — keeping the prior turn's plaintext because the tag was unparseable is the
       fail-OPEN reading §3.2a forbids.
    3. **Assemble** — `segments ++ resolved-binding-segments ++ re-scrubbed-history`.
    4. **Scrub-refuse** (§3.2 step 3) — the fully-assembled payload is scanned by an
       **allowlist** (`unsafe_segment?/1` = "not provably safe"): a segment egresses ONLY if
       it is a `vt_`-free binary, a bounded primitive (number / boolean / `nil`), an
       already-sealed `%MaskedPayload{}`, or a list of such. EVERY other shape — a tuple, a
       keyword list, a map, a struct (`%Samen.Masked{}` / `%Ash.ForbiddenField{}`, a
       still-un-rendered record), an atom, a pid — is unsafe BY CONSTRUCTION ⇒
       `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}`. The inversion is load-bearing: a blocklist of "bad"
       shapes fails OPEN for every shape nobody thought of (a raw `vt_*` token wrapped in an
       EG2 tool-args tuple/keyword/map used to pass), so the predicate enumerates what is
       provably safe and refuses the rest. **Refuse, never silently strip** (the WriteGuard
       posture: a rejected write leaves the wire provably untouched). Free text (user
       keystrokes — a chat question, a draft instruction) is NOT a vault-routed value, so a
       `vt_`-free string passes this scrub (INV-7 governs vault-routed values, not consented
       keystrokes — §3.2 step 2). The operator-responsibility boundary of that free-text
       admission is §7.2.
    5. **Seal** (§3.2 step 4) — mint `%MaskedPayload{}`. The provider boundary accepts ONLY
       this value (runtime clause refusal + the AST single-mint probe).

  ## Why an unmasked prompt cannot reach a provider (the token-blind argument, §3.3)

  The assembling path never POSSESSES unauthorized plaintext: PiiResolution in egress mode
  returns `%Masked{}` (token + label, zero plaintext — "there is no plaintext to leak by any
  serialization path"), and plaintext exists only when a live grant + the host opt-in resolved
  it through the one sanctioned decrypt site. Even a hostile assembler that obtained a `vt_*`
  token finds the scrub refusing it; even code that skips the chokepoint finds no provider
  callback willing to take its string.

  ## EG6 — masked observability by construction (§3.2b, RP-AI-9)

    * `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}` is payload-free: it never embeds the offending segment
      or value — diagnostic context is identifiers only.
    * Adapter errors are NORMALIZED before they propagate (`normalize_error/2`): a raised
      exception or a rich `{:error, term()}` is reduced to a content-free
      `{:provider_error, provider}` — no adapter error can carry the assembled prompt or
      grant-resolved plaintext.
    * `%Samen.AI.MaskedPayload{}` is Inspect-redacting, so a naive log line cannot spill it.

  ## Grounding/meta scrub (T65-F8 close — ADR-043 §3.1 EG1 / §3.2 step 3, T66)

  `:grounding` and `:meta` are EG1 payload fields too ("completion prompts (system +
  GROUNDING + context + user segments)", §3.1), so `seal/3` scrubs them with the SAME
  fail-closed-allowlist principle as `segments` — a bounded-map generalization of
  `safe_segment?/1` (`safe_metadata?/1`, below), not a bespoke second scrub. A `vt_*`-carrying
  or unresolved-vault-field value inside `:grounding`/`:meta` refuses `{:error,
  :pii_egress_refused}` exactly like a `segments` violation, before T66 makes grounding LIVE
  (the D9 runtime catalog, `Samen.AI.Catalog`).

  ## Deferred (per ADR-043 §11)

  T67 fills the embeddings plane (the `Samen.AI.Embedder.Deterministic`, pgvector, the
  embeddable-field allowlist DSL — this chokepoint already REFUSES a vault-routed embed
  input fail-closed). T69 fills the MCP server on the `:mcp` seam. T72 EXTENDS the permanent
  red-team (more adversarial cases + full-DB canary seeding); T65 establishes the tier.

  Mint a `%Samen.AI.MaskedPayload{}` — the ONE minting site (ADR-043 §3.2 step 4), fail-CLOSED.

  Runs the full masking pipeline (moduledoc): resolve `:bindings` in egress mode → re-scrub
  `:history` → assemble → scrub-refuse → seal. Returns `{:ok, %MaskedPayload{}}` only after
  ALL vault-routed content is masked, else `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}` (payload-free).

  `kind` is `:complete | :embed | :mcp`.

  ## Options (the egress context — ADR-043 §3.2)

    * `:actor` / `:scope` — the caller's actor, threaded to `PiiResolution.resolve/4` (egress
      mode). Absent ⇒ the nil-plane default (masked; never plaintext).
    * `:bindings` — `[{records, resource}]` vault-routed record bindings to resolve+mask in
      egress mode. Each resolved vault field renders `••••` (or grant-plaintext for
      `:complete` under the flag). For `:embed`, a vault-routed binding is REFUSED (§7.2).
    * `:grant_egress?` — host opt-in override; defaults to the config flag
      `config :samen_core, Samen.AI, grant_plaintext_egress: <bool>` (default `false`).
      Effective for `:complete` only.
    * `:grant`, `:repo`, `:vault` — passed through to `PiiResolution.resolve/4` (grant-checker
      / vault-repo / vault-module injection — tests inject an approving grant here).
    * `:history` — prior-turn segments (strings, or `{:grant_span, text, %Reveal.Context{}}`
      for grant-tagged spans re-checked per §3.2a).
    * `:tools` — EG2 tool DEFINITIONS (ADR-047 §4.2, A3): a list of bounded static schema
      maps riding the sealed payload's `:tools` field. Scrubbed fail-closed by
      `scrub_tools/1` (below): each def must pass the `safe_metadata?/1` allowlist (keys AND
      values, `vt_`-scanned) AND be byte-identical to an OPTED-IN registry action's
      compile-time `tool_schema/0` — a runtime-composed def REFUSES (the static-schema rule).

  # `:grounding`/`:meta` are CONTRACTUALLY maps (`Samen.AI.MaskedPayload` doc: "a map keyed by
  # bounded label atoms"), unlike `segments` (pre-rendered flat text) — so they cannot be
  # scrubbed by `safe_segment?/1` UNCHANGED: that predicate refuses EVERY map, by design (F1 /
  # sabotage 45 proved a values-only map scan is unsound because it never inspects KEYS, so a
  # `vt_*` token smuggled into a map key would slip a values-only scan). `safe_metadata?/1`
  # below is the SAME fail-closed-allowlist principle, generalized to the shape grounding/meta
  # actually have: every leaf scalar case DELEGATES to `safe_segment?/1` (no independently
  # invented rules); the only NEW cases are the map/list recursion, and — because grounding
  # keys ARE "bounded label atoms" by contract (e.g. `%{table: :accounts}`, the shape every
  # shipped test already uses) — atoms are allowed here (unlike in `segments`, where an atom
  # is not provably safe because a segment is never legitimately an atom).
  #
  # `nil` / `[]` are the natural "no grounding" — a caller who has nothing to ground with
  # (e.g. `grounding: []`, the empty default before a host wires a catalog) is NOT attempting a
  # PII egress, so accept them as empty rather than crying wolf with the `:pii_egress_refused`
  # SECURITY error. Matched ABOVE the scalar/map clauses so an empty list is "no metadata"
  # (there are no leaves to scan), never a shape error.

  # fail-closed gates, both required, refusal payload-free:
  #

  #      bounded label atoms / binaries / numbers / booleans / lists / maps, keys AND
  #      values recursed, `vt_`-scanned, charlist-rendering-scanned, structs refused) —
  #      a canary/`vt_`-bearing description refuses like any metadata violation;
  #   2. **the static-schema rule** — the def must be BYTE-IDENTICAL to an opted-in
  #      `Samen.Automation.Action` module's compile-time `tool_schema/0` constant
  #      (`Samen.AI.Agent.Tools.static_def?/1`). A schema whose `enum` was populated from
  #      live records would be a silent EG2 egress of tenant data on every turn — so a
  #      RUNTIME-COMPOSED tool def refuses HERE, structurally, before A7's AST verifier
  #      check (d) even runs. Dynamic choices are resolved by CALLING a read tool, never
  #      by baking values into a definition.
  #
  # `[]`/nil = "no tools" (the pre-A3 shape of every payload); any non-list refuses.
