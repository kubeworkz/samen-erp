defmodule Samen.AI.Provider.Scripted do
  @moduledoc """
  `Samen.AI.Provider.Scripted` — the deterministic, TURN-SCRIPTED agent-loop test double
  (ADR-047 batches A1+A2; the multi-turn sibling of `Samen.AI.Provider.Fake`).

  Where `Provider.Fake` answers every call with one hash-derived text, an agent-loop test
  needs a provider that answers call 1, call 2, … call N with SCRIPTED, distinct turns —
  so the loop's dynamic next-step selection (continue vs. `FINAL:`), budget accounting
  (per-turn `usage`), and error paths are all drivable keylessly and deterministically.

  ## Scripting

      Scripted.script([
        continue: "looking at the shipment",
        continue: "checking the carrier",
        final: "the carrier missed the pickup window"
      ])

  Entry forms (consumed strictly in order, one per `complete/2` call):

    * `{:continue, text}` — an intermediate assistant turn (`FINAL:`-free by shape);
    * `{:final, text}` — a goal-met turn (`"FINAL: " <> text`);
    * `{:tool_call, kind, args}` — a NATIVE tool selection (A3, ADR-047 §5.2): a
      completion with `tool_calls: [%{"name" => kind, "args" => args}]` and empty text
      (the vendor-native shape an adapter maps into `%Completion{}`);
      `{:tool_call, kind, args, usage}` is the token-budget sugar. The TEXT-envelope
      fallback needs no special form — script `{:continue, ~s(TOOL: {"tool": ...})}`;
    * `{:error, reason}` — a scripted provider failure (the chokepoint EG6-normalizes it);
    * `%{text: ..., usage: %{input_tokens: _, output_tokens: _}}` — full control (token
      budgets); `{:continue | :final, text, usage}` is sugar for the same;
    * a zero-arity fun returning any of the above, evaluated AT CALL TIME — the seam a
      test uses to act *between* turns (issue a durable `Samen.AI.Agent.cancel/2`, flip
      the `Samen.AI.Agent.Breaker` kill-switch, or `exit/1` to simulate a worker death
      mid-turn — the A2 restart-safety proof).

  ## The cross-process seam (A2 — flagged by A1, required by the Oban worker)

  The script and the recording live in `:persistent_term`, NOT the process dictionary:
  A2's `Samen.AI.Agent.TurnWorker` executes turns in whatever process runs the job (an
  Oban drain, a watchdog replay, a spawned crash-simulation Task), and a process-local
  script would make the worker path fail `{:error, :not_configured}` dishonestly-honest
  — scripted work the double could not see. Global state means this double is a
  ONE-RUNNER-AT-A-TIME seam: agent suites run `async: false` and `reset/0` in setup.
  The fail-honest floor is unchanged either way (below).

  ## Fail-honest (ADR-014/024/026 — the contract this double must also honor)

  **No script (or an exhausted script) NEVER returns `{:ok, _}`** — it returns
  `{:error, :not_configured}`, exactly like an unconfigured real adapter: work that was
  not scripted is work not done, and a canned success here is the lie the sabotage
  harness exists to catch. `embed/2` is honestly `{:error, :not_implemented}` (this
  double scripts turns, not vectors).

  ## By-construction refusal + recording

  Both callbacks head-match `%Samen.AI.MaskedPayload{}` (field-LESS match + dot access —
  the single-mint probe convention), so a raw string/map refuses by `FunctionClauseError`
  like every adapter. Every payload RECEIVED is recorded (`sent_payloads/0`, newest
  first) — the A1/A2 history-accumulation/re-scrub assertions read the recording exactly
  as the T72 red-team reads the Fake's. `simulated?/0` is `true`: every completion is
  stamped `simulated: true` by the chokepoint's dispatch site (T152), never parsed from
  text.
