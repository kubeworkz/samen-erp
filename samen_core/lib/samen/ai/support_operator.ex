defmodule Samen.AI.SupportOperator do
  @moduledoc """
  The D5 **AI support operator** (ADR-043 §6.3, T70) — given an inbound support item, it
  DRAFTS a reply and enqueues that draft for HUMAN approval. It **never auto-sends**: the
  ONLY path from a draft to `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint.send/2` is an E3 approval decided by
  a human who is never the requester (`Samen.AI.SupportOperator.ReplyHandler`, ADR-043 §6.3).

  ## What `draft_reply/3` does, in order (and what it deliberately does NOT do)

    1. **Ground (masked).** If an inbound source record is named (`:source_resource` +
       `:source_id`), it is read **org-scoped** (a hard `org_id == ^org` filter — org B can
       never ground on org A's item) and handed to the T68 verb as a `bindings` pair. Every
       vault-routed (🔒) field in that item is `••••`-masked in the provider payload by
       `Samen.AI.Chokepoint` (grants never apply on this operator-plane egress) — the draft
       the human reviews, and what ultimately sends, carries no plaintext and no `vt_*`.
    2. **Draft.** The reply body is composed by a T68 intelligence verb
       (`Samen.AI.Verbs.run/4`, default `:generate`) — whose ONLY provider access is
       `Samen.AI.complete/4` through the masking chokepoint. Keyless in CI (the recording
       Fake); unconfigured outside `:test` ⇒ fail-honest `{:error, :not_configured}`.
    3. **Persist.** The composed reply lands as a `Samen.AI.SupportReplyDraft` row
       (status `:draft`) in the caller's org. This row is the governed domain state the E3
       handler re-derives from — the approval itself stores NO inputs (§4.4).
    4. **Enqueue for approval.** A PENDING approval is opened via `Samen.Approvals.request/2`
       (`kind: "ai_support_reply"`, `subject_ref` = the draft's object-ref,
       `requested_by` = the AI service principal). **Nothing is sent.** `request/2` runs no
       handler — handlers fire only from `approve/3` (a distinct human).

  There is NO code path in this module that reaches `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint.send/2`. The
  send lives solely in `Samen.AI.SupportOperator.ReplyHandler.on_approve/2`, which the
  approvals engine invokes only when a DISTINCT human approves.

  ## The AI service principal (ADR-043 §6.3)

  The operator drafts as a dedicated, auditable AI service principal
  (`principal_id/0`) on the operator plane — it holds no reveal grants and is **never a
  decider**. The engine's distinct-party rule (`decided_by != requested_by`, enforced at
  BOTH the policy layer and the `apv_distinct_party` DB CHECK) means a self-approval by this
  principal is refused fail-closed; the operator additionally exposes NO approve path of its
  own. A human operator, whose id differs from the principal, is the only party who can
  approve — and the send then fires within the draft's own org.

  Draft a reply to an inbound support item in `scope`'s org and enqueue it for HUMAN

  approval opened, and **nothing sent**. `:simulated` is the T152 honesty flag preserved
  verbatim from the `%Samen.AI.Completion{}` (PP-15/PP-16): a keyless/deterministic draft

    * `:subject` — an optional reply subject line
    * `:reason` — a bounded approval reason (PII-scanned by the engine)

  `opts` forwards `:provider`/`:env_reader` to the verb and `:approval_resource`/`:repo`/
  `:kinds`/`:domain` to the engine + source read (the host-wired seams).
