defmodule Samen.AI.Agent.Run do
  @moduledoc """
  `Samen.AI.Agent.Run` — the durable agent-run cursor (ADR-047 §4.1, batches A1+A2).

  One row per agent run: the AshStateMachine lifecycle (`queued → running →
  {succeeded, failed, cancelled, budget_exhausted}`, plus A4's propose-then-approve park
  `running → awaiting_approval → {running, rejected}` — ADR-047 §5.3), the
  turn cursor (`current_turn`), the resolved fail-honest budgets and their consumption
  counters, and the durable cancel flag (`cancel_requested_at`) `Samen.AI.Agent.cancel/2`
  sets and the loop re-checks at EVERY turn boundary (RP-AG-8).

  ## The vault-routed transcript (A2 — ADR-047 §7.4; operator decision §9#4 TAKEN)

  The ONE text artifact a run legitimately persists — the goal (tenant free text) plus
  the rendered assistant lines — lives in the vault-routed `:transcript` attribute
  (`pii do vault(:pii_transcript) … end`): plaintext never lands in the domain column
  (a `vt_*` token does — `Samen.Vault.Change` + `Samen.Type.VaultField`'s last-line
  refusal), the ciphertext sits INSIDE the DEK envelope keyed on the run row's OWN id
  (`Samen.Vault.Change.resolve_subject_id/1` — the framework's per-row crypto-shred
  unit), and subject-level reach is by retention: a default 90-day `:shred` retention
  spec is DERIVED framework-first (`Samen.Erasure.default_specs/1` → the
  `:retention_specs` registry) and asserted by `mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness`'s
  transcript arm. Every other run/turn column stays token-only (ADR-047 §6): ids, enums,
  counts, timestamps — no prompt/completion text outside the envelope, ever.

  ## Durability (A2 — the `Samen.Sequences` shape)

  `next_turn_at` is **never nil while the run is non-terminal** (the Sequences MED-2
  invariant): `:start` arms it at create, every `:advance` re-arms the in-flight
  watchdog window, and only the terminal transitions clear it — exactly once. The
  AshOban `:agent_turn_due` trigger (queue `:automation_timers`, explicit
  `scheduler_cron`, pinned module names so `mix samen.verify.oban_queues` sees both
  generated modules) re-selects any run whose watchdog window elapsed — a crashed
  worker, a lost enqueue, a silently-discarded job — and `:resume_due` re-enqueues
  `Samen.AI.Agent.TurnWorker` INSIDE its own action transaction (the `EventCapture` /
  Sequences `:advance_due` idiom). Writes go through the kernel only
  (`Samen.AI.Agent`); tenant reads are org-scoped through `Samen.Policy.OrgScope`
  (RP-AG-10).
