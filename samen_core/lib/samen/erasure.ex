defmodule Samen.Erasure do
  @moduledoc """
  Crypto-shred orchestration (doc D7/D8; §data; §limits erasure bullet; T1.7).

  `shred/2` is the one entry point that erases a subject. It is a *key-destruction*
  job — NOT a copy-chasing / destruction-by-eventual-consistency job. One key shred
  makes every vaulted value undecryptable across live/replica/backup-PITR/CDC/
  rollup/audit at once (the ciphertext stays; the DEK is gone). The residues that
  live OUTSIDE the per-subject-DEK envelope — so key-shred does NOT reach them — are
  handled by explicit arms here (ADR-046 makes this carve-out list complete):
  trace-sink pseudonyms (unlink with the same DEK), review-gated `non_pii!` plaintext
  columns (redacted row-level), stored file blobs (deleted via the governed
  ref-counted `Samen.Files` chokepoint — §4.3 D4), the recomputable `email_bidx`
  blind index (tombstoned to a random sentinel on principal-account erasure — §4.1 D1),
  Tier-1 `pii_declared: true` custom-bag plaintext (per-key redacted from the sealed
  jsonb bag via `Samen.CustomFields.Erasure` — §4.2 D3), and Tier-2 custom-OBJECT
  `pii_declared: true` record-bag plaintext (per-key redacted from the `tnt_record` bag via
  `Samen.CustomObjects.Erasure` — §8 residual #2).

  ## What `shred/2` does (T1.7 (a)–(d))

    1. **Destroys the subject key** via the `Samen.Kms` adapter (`shred/1`). This
       is the load-bearing act: after it, `Samen.Vault.reveal/3` returns
       `{:error, :shredded}` for EVERY vault row of the subject, everywhere.
    2. **Writes the SHREDDED sentinel** on the subject's `pii_vault` rows
       (`state = "shredded"`, `erased_at = now`). The domain-row token FK now
       points at a dangling / sentinel vault row (doc D7 "down to a dangling
       token"). The ciphertext is left in place (it is useless bytes) so the
       oracle can still *see* that every key-reachable copy is undecryptable.
    3. **Redacts registered `non_pii!` columns** (`Samen.NonPii.redact_for_subject/3`)
       — the plaintext carve-out key-shred cannot reach — and records the tally.
    4. **Emits an audit row** (`rvl_reveal_audit`, event `"erased"`) so the erasure
       is on the tamper-evident lifecycle log the reveal grants already write to.
    5. **Writes + returns the erasure report artifact** (`era_erasure_report`):
       attestation id, outcome, which tiers were touched, redaction tally — the
       artifact the T2.9 oracle consumes.

  Steps 2–5 run in ONE Ecto transaction so a partial erasure never leaves a
  half-stamped state. Step 1 (the key shred) happens FIRST and OUTSIDE the tx: the
  key store is external (ADR-001), so its destruction cannot participate in the
  Postgres transaction — and it is the load-bearing guarantee, so it must succeed
  before we bother sealing the DB tiers. If the DB-tier tx then fails, the key is
  still gone (fail-safe: the data is already unrecoverable); a re-run is idempotent
  and completes the sentinel/redaction/report.

  ## Idempotence

  A second `shred/2` for the same subject is safe. The KMS `shred/1` is idempotent
  (returns the existing tombstone). Sealing already-sealed vault rows is a no-op.
  Re-redaction writes 0 additional cells. The attestation stays positive
  (`:shredded` with `destroyed_at`). A fresh report row is written each call with
  `outcome: "already_shredded"` on the second, so the audit trail shows both calls.

  ## Return

  `{:ok, %{attestation: attestation, report: report}}` on success — the attestation
  is ALWAYS positive after a successful shred (`state: :shredded`). `{:error, term}`
  only if the key store itself is unreachable at shred time (fail-closed: no
  attestation is fabricated).

  DERIVE the canonical erasure specs for a host from its LIVE Ash schema.

  The framework-first activation seam (the erasure analogue of
  `Samen.Jobs.default_queue_config/0` + `install_defaults/1`): rather than every host
  hand-wiring which of its abbrev-prefixed tables carry `email_bidx` / `storage_key`,
  the specs are DERIVED from the host's own materialized resources so a fresh `gen.app`
  is erasure-complete by construction.

  Returns `%{blind_index_erasure_specs: [...], file_erasure_specs: [...]}`:

    * one `blind_index_erasure_spec` per **registered** derived-linkable column
      (`Samen.DerivedLinkable`) — `email_bidx` on Credential/Invitation (subject_column
      `"id"`), `sent_to_bidx` on AuthToken (subject_column `"credential_id"`). An
      UNregistered `_bidx` column is deliberately NOT auto-covered — the completeness
      gate fails it so a new blind index must be registered, never silently activated.
    * one `file_erasure_spec` per **subject-linked** `storage_key` resource (one carrying
      a data-subject field — `uploaded_by_id` for a blob *uploaded BY* a subject, or a
      domain subject-FK like `person_id` for a blob *ABOUT* a subject, ADR-046 §7 #5).
      Org-asset blobs (no subject field, e.g. CMS `Media`) are org-lifecycle, not
      per-subject-erasure residues, and get no subject-keyed spec. (A host with a
      legitimate retention obligation on some about-a-subject blobs adds a `:hold?`
      predicate to the derived spec — the retention-hold exception; see `Samen.Files.Erasure`.)

  Options are passed to `Samen.Erasure.Completeness.resources/1` (`:resources`/`:domains`/
  `:otp_app`) so tests can derive against an explicit resource list.

  A2 (ADR-047 §7.4, §9#4 TAKEN): the derived map also carries one `retention_specs`
  entry per **vault-routed transcript** resource (a `pii do` block declaring
  `:transcript` — `Samen.AI.Agent.Run` is the first) — the default 90-day `:shred`
  retention arm keyed on the row's OWN id (the per-row crypto-shred unit), because a
  transcript's DEK is keyed on the run, not on any person the run discussed, so
  subject-level reach is by retention only. The window is host-configurable
  (`config :samen_core, Samen.AI.Agent, transcript_retention_days: n`); the derived arm
  is what makes `mix samen.gen.app` erasure-complete by construction and what the
  erasure-completeness gate's transcript arm asserts.
