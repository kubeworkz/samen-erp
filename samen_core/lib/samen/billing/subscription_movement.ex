defmodule Samen.Billing.SubscriptionMovement do
  @moduledoc """
  An Ash change that appends ONE `Billing.SubscriptionEvent` (`mov`) row per
  subscription create/update — the subscription-movement capture seam (WS-B / G7;
  ADR-017 §2), modeled on the proven `Samen.Notifications.StatusChange` seam that
  `Invoice` already uses.

  Attached by the `Billing.Subscription` blueprint as:

      change({Samen.Billing.SubscriptionMovement,
        event_resource: Demo.BillingScope.SubscriptionEvent,
        plan_resource: Demo.BillingScope.Plan,
        price_resource: Demo.BillingScope.Price})

  ## Bulk writes (B1 gate note)

  This change runs `after_action`, which forces a NON-atomic strategy: an
  `Ash.bulk_update` on Subscription under the default `:atomic` strategy fails
  closed (`{:error, ...}`, no rows written, no movement missed). Bulk
  subscription mutations must pass an explicit `strategy: :stream` (or
  `:atomic_batches`) — those paths both write AND capture the movement.

  ## Semantics

    * Fires on every subscription create/update, in an `after_action` hook.
    * Resolves the subscription's contributed MRR BEFORE and AFTER the write:
      `mrr_cents = monthly active price of the plan` when the state is revenue-active
      (`:active | :trialing | :past_due`), else `0`. The BEFORE state comes from the
      changeset's original data (an update) or is `nil` (a create).
    * Classifies `(before, after)` via the pure `Samen.Billing.MovementClassifier`
      → a bounded `kind` + signed `mrr_delta_cents` + before/after cents.
    * Appends one `mov` row with those values + the from/to status pair + the plan
      refs + `occurred_at`. A `:reactivation` is distinguished from `:new` by whether
      a prior movement row shows this subscription was ever revenue-active.

  ## Best-effort by contract (the A4 emit pattern)

  This is BEST-EFFORT, exactly like `StatusChange` → `Engine.emit/1`: an append
  failure (event resource unwired, DB hiccup, unresolvable org) NEVER aborts the
  primary subscription write. The subscription state is the load-bearing fact; the
  `mov` row rides alongside. All work is wrapped so nothing here can raise into the
  transaction result.

  A `:noop` movement (no revenue change — e.g. a `past_due → active` cure at the same
  price, or a metadata-only update) is STILL recorded as a `:noop` row, so the ledger
  is a complete audit trail of every subscription mutation; the reconciliation sum is
  unaffected (`:noop` delta is 0).

  ## PII discipline

  Every value written is a bounded id (uuid), an enum, a signed integer, or a
  timestamp. No subject PII enters a `mov` row by construction (the resource carries
  no PII columns; ADR-017 §3).
