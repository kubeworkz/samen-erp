defmodule Samen.Billing.Dunning do
  @moduledoc """
  The vendor-generic B7 dunning logic (T24; ADR-038 §3.5 "B7 dunning (T24):
  driven exclusively from `:invoice_payment_failed` normalized events — never
  from polling, never simulated. Retry schedule is mirrored provider truth;
  the grace-period entitlement policy is core logic on the mirror").

  `samen_core` owns this logic (INV-4) — the vendor adapter package only
  translates + transports (`fetch_object(:invoice, …)`); it never decides
  org-scoping, the grace boundary, or what the mirror row looks like.

  `Samen.Billing.WebhookDispatch` (the shared T19 seam's billing consumer)
  wires THIS module onto the clean hook `Samen.Billing.Reconciler` already
  leaves for `:invoice_payment_failed` (`{:ok, :deferred_dunning}`) — the
  subscription-lifecycle reconciler is untouched by this task. Recovery
  (`recover/2`) is wired onto the SIBLING `:invoice_paid` kind (already routed
  to `Samen.Billing.Invoice`, T22) as an ADDITIONAL, best-effort consumer —
  Dunning never re-fetches or re-decides invoice state for recovery; it trusts
  that `Samen.Billing.Invoice` already reconciled the authoritative "paid" fact
  and merely closes ITS OWN case + restores entitlement.

  ## `reconcile/2` — open / advance (done-criterion 1)

  1. No `object_id` ref (the invoice's own provider id — the webhook object IS
     the invoice, exactly like `Samen.Billing.Invoice`) ⇒ `{:ok, :ignored}`.
  2. Idempotency + out-of-order gate (`gate/2` — the SAME two-clause shape
     `Samen.Billing.Reconciler.gate/2` uses, ADR-038 §3.4(2)/(3), applied here
     to the dunning case instead of the subscription mirror):
       * an EXACT replay of the event that already produced the current case's
         state (`last_event_id` match) is `{:ok, :duplicate}` — skips a wasted
         authoritative re-fetch;
       * a DIFFERENT event whose `occurred_at` is strictly OLDER than the
         case's stored `watermark` (the last-applied event's `occurred_at`) is
         `{:ok, :stale}` — DISCARDED before any fetch/write/entitlement-clip.
         This is what stops a stale, distinct-event-id `:invoice_payment_failed`
         arriving AFTER a later `:invoice_paid` recovery from re-opening the
         case or re-clipping a paid customer's entitlement to grace. A TIE
         (`occurred_at == watermark`) is NOT stale — it PROCEEDS, exactly
         matching the Reconciler's own tie semantics (`DateTime.compare/2 ==
         :lt` is the only short-circuit; `:eq`/`:gt` both proceed).
  3. Authoritative re-fetch (ADR-038 §3.4(1) — never trust the webhook payload
     for state): `provider.fetch_object(:invoice, invoice_id, provider_config)`.
     The retry-schedule fields (`attempt_count`, `next_payment_attempt`) and
     the grace boundary (`period_end`) are MIRRORED VERBATIM from this
     snapshot — never recomputed here (mirrors the invoice/subscription
     reconcilers' "provider is the source of truth" discipline).
  4. `dunning_mirror.write_case/2` upserts the case row, keyed on
     `provider_invoice_id` — creates on first delivery, UPDATES THE SAME ROW
     on every subsequent delivery (a further retry attempt re-mirrors the
     CURRENT attempt_count/next_payment_attempt onto the same row — "the
     retry schedule advances" IS this idempotent re-mirror, not a growing
     list).
  5. Grace-period entitlement (done-criterion 2): `mirror.apply_entitlement/3`
     is called with `{:grace_until, period_end}` for the invoice's
     subscription — entitlement remains active THROUGH the invoice's period
     end even though payment failed, exactly extending T21's cancel-grace
     model (`Samen.Billing.Mirror` §"Entitlement transition") to the
     payment-failure path. If the grace boundary elapses before a recovery,
     the SAME already-existing `expires_at`-vs-now check
     (`Samen.Scopes.Billing.Entitlement.entitled_direct?/4`) naturally flips
     to not-entitled — no separate "drop" code path is needed.
  6. Best-effort notification (done-criterion 3): a `:payment_failed`
     lifecycle email is enqueued via `Samen.Delivery.Lifecycle.deliver/2`,
     which routes through `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint` (suppression honored)
     exactly like every other C2 send family. This RIDES ALONGSIDE the
     dunning-case write and NEVER fails/aborts it (mirrors
     `Samen.Delivery.Lifecycle`'s own "best-effort, never raises" contract).

  ## `recover/2` — close (done-criterion 1 + 2 "recovered" control)

  Triggered by `:invoice_paid` for an invoice that has an OPEN dunning case.
  An invoice that never failed (the overwhelming common case) has no case row
  (`exists: false`) ⇒ `{:ok, :ignored}` — a true no-op, never a spurious write.
  Runs through the SAME `gate/2` as `reconcile/2` (an exact-event-id replay is
  `{:ok, :duplicate}`; a stale, older-than-watermark recovery is `{:ok, :stale}`
  — coherent in both directions: a delayed `:invoice_paid` can no more clobber
  a NEWER dunning-open than a delayed `:invoice_payment_failed` can clobber a
  recovery). Otherwise: the case flips to `:recovered` (its `occurred_at`
  ADVANCES the watermark, so a later stale `:invoice_payment_failed` is
  correctly discarded per §"open / advance" step 2), entitlement is restored
  via `mirror.apply_entitlement/3` with `:active` (clears any grace
  `expires_at` — see `Samen.Billing.Mirror`'s moduledoc), and a best-effort
  `:payment_recovered` lifecycle email is enqueued the same way.

  ## E5 escalation client (ADR-039 §7.4 — T41 adoption seam)

  `reconcile/2` and `recover/2` keep every line above VERBATIM. They ADDITIONALLY
  ride `Samen.Automation.Escalate.open/2` (`kind: "dunning"`, `dedupe_key:
  provider_invoice_id`, `deadline_at:` the grace boundary/`period_end`) on open/
  advance, and `Escalate.resolve/3` (`{org_id, "dunning", provider_invoice_id}`,
  `:resolved`) on recovery. Best-effort, same posture as the existing lifecycle
  email: never re-decides, never aborts the case/entitlement write above, and is
  skipped (not attempted) when no `org_id` is available (a bare invoice webhook
  carries none of its own — see below) — mirrors this module's own
  "notification is side-effect-only, never gates the outcome" discipline.

  ## Org resolution for notifications (an honest, host-injectable seam)

  A bare invoice webhook carries no `org_id` of its own (ingress happens before
  org attribution — the same posture `Samen.Billing.AshInvoiceMirror` documents).
  `opts[:org_id]` is caller-supplied (in production, `Samen.Billing.WebhookDispatch`
  resolves it via an OPTIONAL `:billing_dunning_org_resolver` config function,
  same host-injectable shape as `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint`'s suppression
  module). Absent an org_id, `Samen.Delivery.Lifecycle.deliver/2` degrades to
  its own honest `{:ok, :skipped}` — the dunning-case/entitlement writes above
  are UNAFFECTED either way (notification is side-effect-only, never gates the
  case/entitlement outcome).
