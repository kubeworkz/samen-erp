  **Post-shred INGRESS-CLASS assertion for the trace/event sink** (doc §runs oracle

  This tier is the destruction-oracle counterpart to the CI-mode `TraceSink` tier.
  It is deliberately a **SCHEMA assertion, not a content scan** — the sink is
  third-party (Honeycomb/Tempo/Loki) and append-only, so key-shred cannot reach it.
  The oracle instead proves that only tokens / bounded IDs / per-subject-keyed
  pseudonyms could EVER have entered it (`Samen.WideEvent.Schema.violations/0` —
  the same J2 build-time allow-list), and that the subject's `actor_id` pseudonym
  goes unlinkable on key destruction (RQ5): `Samen.Vault.pseudonym/1` must FAIL
  (`:shredded`) post-shred, riding oracle check 3's KMS destruction.

  A string field smuggled into the wide-event/span schema is a violation here (the
  laundered-name-carrier surface), exactly as in CI mode — the schema is the
  invariant, valid in every run.

  ## What the load-bearing defence is (and what it is NOT)

  This tier asserts over the **schema** (`Schema.violations/0`), which is the
  load-bearing J2 guarantee: **no free-string field exists**, so a laundered PII
  value has nowhere to land. That is a build-checked structural invariant
  (`mix samen.verify.sink_schema`), not a scan of values.

  Separately, `Samen.WideEvent.new/1`/`emit/1` apply a **runtime value-shape
  heuristic** (`Samen.PiiValueShape`) that rejects a value whose shape is obviously
  PII (email/phone/SSN/space-separated name) in a bounded ID/token field, and a
  PII/name-shaped atom in an open `:enum`. That runtime check is a *heuristic, not
  a taint proof* — a single-token opaque value that happens to be a real surname is
  indistinguishable from a legitimate token by shape alone. The oracle does not and
  cannot lean on the runtime heuristic for its guarantee; the **schema-level
  no-free-string-field invariant is what is load-bearing** here.

  ## Positive attestation

  `:post_shred` tier: emits `:pass` for the two ingress guarantees it clears (schema
  bounded, pseudonym unlinked), `:violation` on a schema hole or a still-computable
  pseudonym. Never empty.
