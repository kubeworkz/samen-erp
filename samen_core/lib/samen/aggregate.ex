defmodule Samen.Aggregate do
  @moduledoc """
  The **token-blind aggregate plane** runtime (T4.2; doc §control "Two planes, two
  operator paths").

  > Cross-tenant views (MRR, queues) run on a separate token-blind actor whose
  > resources have no pii_ columns at all. The two paths are mutually exclusive.

  This is the SEPARATE operator path from masked impersonation (T4.1). Where
  impersonation reaches ONE tenant org's real rows (masked by default), the
  aggregate plane runs CROSS-TENANT and token-blind: the `operator_aggregate` actor
  (`Samen.Aggregate.Actor`, no `org_id`) reads a **vault-excluded projection** — the
  `rol_*`/summary tables where `pii_` columns physically don't exist.

  ## What this module does

    1. `read/2` — read an aggregate-plane resource with the singleton aggregate
       actor. The resource's default-deny policy (`Samen.Policy.AggregateActorOnly`)
       admits ONLY that actor; the read carries no org boundary because there is no
       org — it spans all tenants. Because the resource is a `use
       Samen.Aggregate.Resource` (C7-verified) projection over a `rol_*` table, no
       PII is reachable.

    2. **Mutual exclusion, both directions** — `Samen.Aggregate` is deliberately the
       ONLY surface the aggregate actor can use:

         * `Samen.Reveal.reveal/5` refuses an `:operator_aggregate` actor
           structurally (aggregate ⟂ reveal — T4.2), so the aggregate actor can
           never cross the reveal seam.
         * `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` filters an org-less actor to ZERO rows, so the
           aggregate actor can never read a tenant-plane resource.
         * `Samen.Policy.AggregateActorOnly` refuses every non-aggregate actor, so a
           tenant / impersonation / api_key actor can never read the aggregate plane.

  ## Cross-tenant MRR / queue-depth reads

  Operator dashboards call `Samen.Aggregate.read/2` (or `read_all/2`) to get
  cross-tenant MRR (from Billing rollups) and support-queue depths (from the T2.3
  event rollups). Those are the two doc examples: "Cross-tenant views (MRR, queues)".
  Each reads a bounded projection (tier / count / cents) — never a subject.

  ## Aggregate-privacy floors + query budget (T4.5 + T6.6)

  `read_all/2` is the ONLY read surface the token-blind aggregate actor can use, so it
  is where the **output-privacy floors** are enforced and where the **query budget** is
  accounted and (opt-in) enforced — you cannot read a raw, unsuppressed aggregate value
  "as the aggregate actor" through the domain, because this chokepoint routes every row
  set through the pipeline before returning it:

    1. **Query-budget accounting + enforcement** — every returned cohort is recorded in
       `Samen.Aggregate.QueryBudget`, keyed by cohort (NOT by actor). By default this is
       accounting-only (WARN-not-enforce, T4.5). When `:query_budget_enforce` is on
       (T6.6), a cohort whose per-cohort (or the global) budget is spent within the window
       has its value REPLACED by `%Samen.Aggregate.Suppressed{reason: :query_budget}` —
       the CROSS-QUERY defence (repeated-overlap / differencing / collusion), keyed
       per-cohort so two colluding actors share ONE budget. Recording is best-effort; the
       enforcement CHECK fails open (the floors, which fail closed, are the independent
       single-query defence).

    2. **k-anonymity + l-diversity floors (ENFORCED)** — the row set passes through
       `Samen.Aggregate.Privacy.apply/3` using the resource's `aggregate_cohort_spec/0`
       (`Samen.Aggregate.CohortSpec`). Any cell whose cohort count is `< k`
       (count-of-one included) or whose distinct-sensitive count is `< l` (a homogeneous
       cohort) has its value REPLACED by `%Samen.Aggregate.Suppressed{}` (T4.5 clauses
       (a)+(b)). Fail closed: a resource with NO cohort spec returns
       `{:error, :no_cohort_spec}` — an aggregate cell whose cohort size cannot be
       established is not released.

  Order matters: the budget is accounted+checked FIRST (it bounds how many QUERIES a
  cohort may receive, independent of a single query's shape), then the floors run (they
  bound a single query's OUTPUT). A cohort suppressed by the budget is not re-suppressed
  by the floors — the FIRST suppression that fires (budget, then k-anon, then l-div) wins.

  A caller can pass `suppress: false` ONLY on internal control paths (the ledger rebuild
  reads its own raw rows) — the operator dashboard NEVER does; suppression is the default
  and the demo dashboard depends on it.

  @doc """
  Read every row of an aggregate-plane resource with the singleton token-blind
  aggregate actor. Returns `{:ok, rows}` or `{:error, reason}`.

  The read is authorized (`authorize?: true`) against the resource's default-deny
  policy — so this only succeeds because the actor IS the aggregate actor. A read
  attempted with any other actor (or actor-less) returns zero rows / forbidden.

  Refuses (`{:error, :not_aggregate_resource}`) if the resource did not opt into the
  aggregate plane (`use Samen.Aggregate.Resource`) — fail closed: you cannot read a
  tenant-plane resource "as the aggregate actor" through here.

  Options:
    * `:actor` — override the actor (tests use this to prove a NON-aggregate actor is
      refused). Defaults to `Samen.Aggregate.Actor.new/0`.
    * `:query` — a preset `Ash.Query` (e.g. a filter/sort over bounded columns).
    * `:suppress` — apply the k-anon / l-diversity floors (T4.5). Defaults to `true`
      (the enforced default; the operator dashboard relies on it). `false` is an
      internal control-path escape for callers that read their own raw rows (the ledger
      rebuild) — it does NOT route through the domain's operator-facing path.
    * `:account` — record the read in the query-budget ledger (T4.5 clause (c)) AND run
      the opt-in enforcing budget check (T6.6). Defaults to `true`. `false` suppresses
      both for internal/no-op reads.
    * `:k` / `:l` — override the floors (tests use this; production reads config).
    * `:epsilon` / `:sensitivity` — override the opt-in DP noise parameters (T6.6; only
      applied when `:dp_enabled` is on). Production reads `:dp_epsilon` from config.

  Read an **org-scoped** aggregate-plane resource as the tenant's OWN org actor — the
  P17 intra-org analytics path (ADR-045 §3). Returns `{:ok, floored_rows}` or
  `{:error, reason}`.

  This is the SEPARATE, org-scoped sibling of `read_all/2` — it is NOT a relaxation of
  T144 and NOT the token-blind cross-tenant plane. Three structural differences make it
  the "separate org-scoped path" ADR-045 §3 demands rather than a weakening of the gate:

    1. **It runs as the caller's OWN org actor**, not the org-less
       `Samen.Aggregate.Actor`. The resource guards reads with `Samen.Policy.OrgScope`
       (a `FilterCheck`), so the read is narrowed to `org_id == actor.org_id` — a
       foreign org's rows are INVISIBLE (not merely forbidden). Cross-org is impossible
       by construction, the same mechanism the tenant plane already relies on.

    2. **It refuses an org-LESS actor, fail closed** (`{:error, :org_scope_required}`),
       BEFORE any row is read. So the token-blind cross-tenant `Aggregate.Actor` (no
       `org_id`) can never reach the org-scoped plane through here, and an
       unauthenticated/org-less caller reads nothing — defense-in-depth ABOVE OrgScope's
       own zero-rows filter.

    3. **It refuses a non-org-scoped aggregate resource** (`{:error,
       :not_org_scoped_aggregate}`) — you cannot read a cross-tenant
       (`AggregateActorOnly`) projection "as an org actor" through here. The resource
       must opt in via `org_scoped_aggregate?/0` (verified to carry a non-null `org_id`
       partition by the org-scoped arm of `mix samen.verify.aggregate_privacy`).

  Everything downstream REUSES the shipped output-privacy floor unchanged: the rows pass
  through `Samen.Aggregate.Privacy.apply/3` using the resource's `aggregate_cohort_spec/0`
  (`Samen.Aggregate.CohortSpec`). A cohort whose count is `< k` (count-of-one included) or
  whose distinct-sensitive count is `< l` has its value columns REPLACED by
  `%Samen.Aggregate.Suppressed{}` — so a lower-privilege, `••••`-masked tenant role that
  can enumerate a cohort key cannot reconstruct a suppressed value or re-identify a
  count-of-one cohort. A resource with NO cohort spec fails closed (`:no_cohort_spec`).
  The C7 `NoPiiColumns` compile-time refusal (via `use Samen.Aggregate.Resource`)
  guarantees no vault/`pii_` column is projectable in the first place.

  Options:
    * `:actor` is NOT taken here — the org actor is the required 2nd argument (a
      `%Samen.Scope{}` or a plain actor map carrying `:org_id`).
    * `:query` — a preset `Ash.Query` over bounded columns (still OrgScope-narrowed).
    * `:k` / `:l` — override the floors (tests use this to prove the floor is
      load-bearing; production reads config, default k=5 / l=2).

  There is deliberately NO `suppress: false` escape on the org-scoped path (unlike the
  internal control path on `read_all/2`): an org-facing analytics read ALWAYS floors.
