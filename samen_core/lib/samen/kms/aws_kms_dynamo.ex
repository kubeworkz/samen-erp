defmodule Samen.Kms.AwsKmsDynamo do
  @moduledoc """
  Production `Samen.Kms` adapter skeleton — AWS KMS + DynamoDB with PITR off
  (ADR-001 §8.1, Candidate A; T1.4 scope).

  ## Status: SKELETON

  This module compiles and passes the conformance-suite shape — it implements
  every callback in `Samen.Kms` — but **all network calls are guarded behind a
  config flag** and are NOT exercised in CI (no AWS account is required). The
  guard is `Application.get_env(:samen_core, :aws_kms_dynamo_enabled, false)`.

  When the flag is `false` (the default, and always in CI), every callback
  returns a documented stub response. When the flag is `true`, the adapter
  is expected to call AWS KMS + DynamoDB; that path is left as a `TODO` stub
  that raises a clear error rather than silently misbehaving.

  ## Production wiring plan (not yet implemented)

  The production path would use:
    - `ex_aws` + `ex_aws_kms` for KMS.Encrypt / KMS.Decrypt
    - `ex_aws_dynamo` for the wrapped-DEK DynamoDB table
    - The DynamoDB table `samen_wrapped_deks` with:
        * PITR DISABLED (the load-bearing config — load-bearing for RQ1)
        * IAM Deny on CreateBackup / ExportTableToPointInTime / UpdateContinuousBackups
        * Schema: PK = subject_id; attributes: wrapped_dek, state, created_at, destroyed_at,
          attestation_id, km_version

  ## Conformance suite

  When `aws_kms_dynamo_enabled: false`, the adapter behaves as an in-memory stub
  so the conformance suite can be run against it without a live AWS account.
  The stub delegates to `Samen.Kms.InMemory` under the hood for that purpose.

  ## ADR-001 §8.2 obligations for this adapter (when enabled)

  1. PITR cannot resurrect the key — the DynamoDB table has PITR disabled; a
     `DescribeContinuousBackups` call asserting `DISABLED` must pass the oracle's
     check-2.
  2. Post-shred decrypt raises `:shredded` — `unwrap/1` after `shred/1`.
  3. Attestation is positive, not mere absence — `attest/1` returns `state: :shredded`
     with a `destroyed_at`; `:absent` is FAIL for post-shred oracle assertion.
  4. Pseudonym unlinks on shred — `pseudonym/2` raises `:shredded` after `shred/1`.
  5. KMS/store outage fails closed — `unwrap/1` returns `:unavailable`, never plaintext.
  6. `backups_disabled?/0` returns `false` when PITR is on — oracle check-2 exits 1.
  7. `key_material_present?/1` returns `false` after shred — the wrapped-DEK item
     is actually DELETED from DynamoDB (a `GetItem` returns no item), not merely
     tombstoned. The oracle's check-2b asserts this so a tombstone-written-but-DEK-
     left "shred" fails closed (Gate-0 vault-stack fix, P2 shred defence-in-depth).
     Production: `shred/1` must `DeleteItem` the wrapped DEK and then confirm via
     `GetItem` that it is gone BEFORE writing the positive tombstone.

  None of these are verified in CI for this skeleton. They are stated here as the
  acceptance criteria for when `aws_kms_dynamo_enabled: true` is wired in production.

  Declares this adapter an UNIMPLEMENTED SKELETON (ADR-045 §4.2, O5). The framework prod boot
  guard (`Samen.Kms.assert_prod_adapter_ready!/1`, called at a mount-bearing host's
  `Application.start/2`) REFUSES to boot a production host that selects a skeleton adapter —
  rather than boot green and then 500 on every vault operation. When the real AWS KMS + DynamoDB
  calls in this module are wired (the ADR-001 §8.2 obligations in the moduledoc), REMOVE this
  function (or make it return `false`) so the boot guard admits the now-functional adapter.
