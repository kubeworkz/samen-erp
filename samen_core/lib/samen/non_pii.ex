defmodule Samen.NonPii do
  @moduledoc """
  The `non_pii!` registry (doc D8; §limits carve-out (b); T1.7 (b)).

  A `non_pii!` exception is a **review-gated** declaration that a specific
  physical column is plaintext-at-rest by design. Two reviewers must agree
  (`cleared_by` != `reviewed_by`) — the same distinct-party discipline the reveal
  grant uses. This module is the **registry**: it records the accepted override
  (with who/why metadata) and exposes the erasure recipe. The *enforcement UX*
  — failing the build until a flagged plain column has an entry — is the T1.8c
  `pii_classify` verifier, out of scope here.

  ## What this module owns (T1.7 scope)

    * `register/1` — record a review-gated override. Refuses self-review
      (`cleared_by == reviewed_by`) — fail closed, the same distinct-party rule as
      reveal grants (defence against a single actor waving a plaintext column
      through). Idempotent per `(table, column)`.
    * `entries/1`, `catalog_flags/1` — the registry read side the catalog and the
      oracle consume.
    * `redact_for_subject/3` — the **erasure arm**: row-level redaction of every
      registered plaintext column for a subject, writing the recipe's redaction
      sentinel over the plaintext value. Returns the count redacted. Called only
      by `Samen.Erasure`.

  ## Why redaction, not key-shred (D8)

  Key-shred destroys the subject DEK, which makes every *vaulted* value
  undecryptable at once. A `non_pii!` column is NOT vaulted — it is plaintext —
  so key-shred does not touch it. The limits name it explicitly as a carve-out
  key-shred does not reach. Erasure must therefore reach it directly, by
  overwriting the plaintext with a non-reversible sentinel (row-level redaction),
  and record that it ran so the oracle's `registered_non_pii` tier can assert it.

    * `:cleared_by`  — who requested the exception
