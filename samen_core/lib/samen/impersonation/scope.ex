defmodule Samen.Impersonation.Scope do
  @moduledoc """
  Turn an active impersonation session into a tenant-plane `%Samen.Scope{}` (T4.1
  clause (b); doc §control: the operator "sees its real UI, but the session carries no
  reveal grant, so personal data renders •••• by default … the tenant's own policies
  apply unchanged").

  ## What the impersonation scope IS

  It is a NORMAL tenant `%Samen.Scope{}` — the SAME struct a tenant member carries —
  whose actor map carries:

    * `:org_id`   — the TARGET org from the session. This is the tenant boundary, so
      `Samen.Policy.OrgScope` (the org-scope FilterCheck) narrows every read to the
      target org's rows, exactly as it would for a real member. The impersonating
      operator sees the tenant's REAL data shape (T4.1 clause (e)).
    * `:role`     — `:member` (a member-EQUIVALENT role). The tenant's RBAC applies
      unchanged: an impersonating operator has member-level reach into the tenant,
      NOT owner/admin. Read-heavy support is member-equivalent; nothing here elevates
      to `:admin`/`:owner`.
    * `:id`       — the OPERATOR's id (bounded). So an audit/log of a mutation under
      impersonation attributes to the operator, not to a fake tenant user.
    * `:impersonation` — a marker `%{operator_id, org_id, session_id}` proving this is
      an impersonated scope (a plain member scope has no such key). The plane resolver
      keys on this to keep PII MASKED.

  ## Why the PII stays masked (the whole point)

  The scope carries **NO reveal grant**. The reveal seam (`Samen.Reveal`) is consulted
  independently of the scope: it asks the configured `Samen.Reveal.Grant` model whether
  THIS actor holds a live, distinct-party-approved grant for THIS subject. An
  impersonating operator holds no such grant (unless they open the SEPARATE T1.6 reveal
  path on top), so every vaulted field the impersonating scope reads stays `%Masked{}`
  and renders `••••` through LiveView / JSON / CSV / log — by construction, not by an
  extra strip. The impersonation actor's `:plane` is set to `:operator`, so the API
  egress path (`Samen.Api.PiiResolution`) also treats a vaulted field as ABSENT unless
  a live grant covers the subject — the same egress matrix the tenant/operator key
  classes already use (T3.11).

  ## Fail-closed construction (T4.1 red path: expired denies mid-flight)

  `for_session/1` re-checks the session is ACTIVE (`Samen.Impersonation.Sessions.active?/2`)
  at build time — a per-request check. A caller that builds the scope on every request
  (the intended pattern) gets deny-on-read: the moment `now() > expires_at`, the
  session is inactive and `for_session/1` returns `{:error, :session_inactive}` — the
  operator's request fails closed exactly like no session. This is the "policy checks
  expiry per-request, not per-open" guarantee: rebuild the scope each request and an
  expired session denies mid-flight.

  ## Suspension terminates a LIVE session on its next request (F4.2, Gate-4 carry)

  Expiry is not the only per-request gate. `for_session/3` ALSO consults
  `Samen.OperatorPlane.Suspension.suspended?/2` for the session's operator on every
  rebuild. Suspending an operator mid-session (T4.4 auto-suspend, or an explicit
  operator-plane suspend) therefore ENDS an already-open impersonation session on its
  NEXT request: the rebuild returns `{:error, :operator_suspended}` — the same
  access-denied shape a suspended operator gets on every other reveal/operator path —
  even though the underlying `imp_impersonation_session` row is still unexpired and
  open. This closes the "a suspension does not touch a session already in flight" gap:
  `open/1` refuses to START a session while suspended, and `for_session/3` refuses to
  CONTINUE one. The suspension check is fail-closed (`suspended?/2` defaults to
  "treat as suspended" when the suspension table is unreachable), so a rebuild that
  cannot confirm the operator is un-suspended denies.

  The positive control (anti-tautology): an UNSUSPENDED operator's active session keeps
  rebuilding to `{:ok, scope}` — the deny is the suspension gate firing, not a blanket
  refusal.

  @doc """
  Build a tenant `%Samen.Scope{}` from an operator + a target org, validating there is
  an ACTIVE impersonation session for that pair AT BUILD TIME (per-request expiry
  check).

  Returns:
    * `{:ok, %Samen.Scope{}}` — an active session exists AND the operator is not
      suspended; the scope carries the target org_id, a `:member` role, the operator
      id, `:plane => :operator`, and the `:impersonation` marker. NO reveal grant.
    * `{:error, :operator_suspended}` — the session's operator is suspended (F4.2). A
      live session ends on its NEXT request when its operator is suspended mid-session.
      Fail-closed: an unreachable suspension table also denies here.
    * `{:error, :session_inactive}` — no active/unexpired session for this pair
      (fail closed). Covers: never opened, closed, expired mid-flight.

  The suspension check runs BEFORE the session lookup so a suspended operator is denied
  regardless of session state (a suspended operator has no operator-plane reach at all).

  Options:
    * `:repo` — override the configured repo.
    * `:now`  — inject the clock (for the anti-tautology expiry probe).
