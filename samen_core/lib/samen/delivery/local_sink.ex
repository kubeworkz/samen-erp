defmodule Samen.Delivery.LocalSink do
  @moduledoc """
  Dev/test delivery adapter — an HONEST "captured, not delivered" (ADR-014 §2).
  Migrated to `Samen.Delivery.Provider` (ADR-038 §4.2 rename); semantics
  unchanged.

  `LocalSink` does NOT send a real email. It logs the token-only
  `Samen.Delivery.Message` (opaque IDs only — no revealed recipient email) and
  returns `{:ok, %{sink: true, ...}}`. Because the receipt is explicitly tagged
  `sink: true`, a send it "delivers" is provably NOT a real dispatch — the
  captured flag travels with the send's receipt so a reader can never mistake a
  sink capture for a live delivery.

  ## NOT an Ash resource (orchestrator decision)

  `LocalSink` is a plain log, NOT an Ash resource and NOT a database table. This
  is deliberate: realizing it as a resource would demand a new per-mount abbrev
  (`dsk`) and a suppression-style abbrev tax on every vertical. A process/log sink
  needs no abbrev registry entry (design.md §Data map note). If a host wants a
  durable capture table it can supply its own adapter; the kernel default stays a
  log.

  `configured?/1` is always `true` — the sink is always "ready" because capturing
  is a local no-network operation. It is only *selected* in dev/test (the
  `SendWorker` chooses it as the default adapter when env is `:test`); it must
  never be the default in prod (a prod send that "delivered" to a log is exactly
  the lie ADR-014 forbids, so the SendWorker refuses an unconfigured prod adapter
  rather than falling back to the sink).
