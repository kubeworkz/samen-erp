defmodule Samen.Delivery.Rendering do
  @moduledoc """
  PII-safe email rendering (C3, T29) — the vendor-generic CORE seam that turns a
  token-only `Samen.Delivery.Message` into a `Samen.Delivery.RenderedEmail` by
  resolving the recipient's address (and any vault-routed body fields) THROUGH
  `Samen.Api.PiiResolution` on the actor's plane. This is the INV-1 load-bearing
  render path: the recipient of an email legitimately needs plaintext (the mail is
  addressed TO them), so the **send plane resolves plaintext**; an operator
  previewing the same message holds no reveal grant, so the **operator plane
  masks** (`••••`).

  ## Why this lives in core (INV-4)

  Rendering is vendor-generic: it resolves fields through the single governed read
  path and interpolates them into a template. No ESP is special-cased and no vendor
  dep is pulled — the three first-party-but-separate adapter packages (ADR-038 §8)
  call `render_for_send/4` + `RenderedEmail.provider_payload/1` to obtain the
  minimal payload rather than hand-revealing/hand-masking inside `deliver/2`. Core
  stays green with every adapter absent.

  ## Never bypass PiiResolution, never hand-mask

  Every field that could be PII is resolved by `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4`
  — the SAME seam every framework read surface (list/detail reads, CSV export
  cells, search projections, the notifications inbox) runs on. This module holds NO
  masking logic of its own; the plane decides, the resolver masks. On the send
  plane a vault-routed field resolves to plaintext (the recipient owns the mail);
  on an operator-preview plane it stays `%Samen.Masked{}` unless a reveal grant
  covers the subject.

  ## Composing the T28 send path

  `render_for_send/4` is what the `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint` send path (and the
  ESP adapters it routes to) call to build the recipient-facing payload — see
  `Samen.Delivery.Chokepoint.render_for_send/4`, which delegates here.
  `preview_for_operator/4` renders the SAME message on the operator plane for an
  operator-facing preview surface, where it masks.

  ## The template

  `render/5` interpolates the resolved fields into a template function
  (`:template` opt; a sane vendor-generic default otherwise). Interpolating a
  resolved value uses `String.Chars`, so a `%Masked{}` renders `••••` in the body
  automatically — the mask is the field's normal value, not a special case here.
  A host/adapter supplies its real templates via the `:template` opt.
