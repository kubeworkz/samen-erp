defmodule Samen.Delivery.Lifecycle.EmailWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker for **transactional lifecycle emails** — welcome/onboarding,
  trial-ending, payment-failed/dunning, subscription-cancelled — dispatched
  THROUGH the existing `Samen.Delivery.Provider` boundary (ADR-038 §4.2 rename
  of the ADR-014 `Samen.Delivery.Adapter` contract), **fail-honest** (ADR-014
  §3). This is the transactional-email sibling of
  `Samen.Scopes.Marketing.SendWorker`: same Invariant D1 discipline, same
  env-dependent adapter resolution, same token-only job args — but for
  event-triggered lifecycle mail rather than bulk marketing sends.

  No first-party ESP/SMTP adapter ships here (F1 declined it): the host BYOs the
  adapter per `docs/guides/byo-esp.md`. With no configured adapter in a non-`:test`
  env a lifecycle email is **blocked** (never faked to `:sent`), exactly like a
  blocked marketing send.

  ## Job args convention (token-only — F2.1)

  Job args carry ONLY opaque IDs, tokens, and one bounded event enum — NEVER
  plaintext PII (the row is safe to persist to `oban_jobs`):

    * `send_id`       — opaque lifecycle correlation UUID (minted at enqueue; the
      `Samen.Delivery.Message` canonical identity — there is NO persisted send row,
      lifecycle mail is a stateless enqueue+deliver over existing subscriber refs)
    * `org_id`        — opaque UUID of the owning org (scoping)
    * `subscriber_id` — opaque UUID of the recipient (email is in the vault, not args)
    * `template_id`   — opaque UUID (nilable)
    * `event`         — the bounded lifecycle-event enum (see `events/0`): one of
      `"welcome" | "onboarding" | "trial_ending" | "payment_failed" |
      "payment_recovered" | "subscription_cancelled"`

  Recipient email is revealed from the vault at `deliver/2` time under a grant
  (the BYO adapter's governed read) — never in job args, never in a receipt.

  ## Fail-honest delivery (Invariant D1 carried to the lifecycle path)

  `perform/1` realizes `Samen.Delivery.Provider` with three honest outcomes,
  mirroring the marketing worker:

    1. **No configured adapter, non-`:test` env** → `:blocked` (NOT `:sent`): an
       operator-visible notification (`lifecycle.email.blocked`) is emitted through
       `Samen.Notifications.Engine.emit/1` and `perform/1` returns
       `{:error, :adapter_unconfigured}` so Oban retries/alerts. It NEVER returns
       `:ok`/`:sent`. In `:test` the default adapter is `LocalSink` (honest
       "captured, not delivered"), so tests exercise the happy path with no wiring.
    2. **`adapter.deliver/2 -> {:ok, receipt}`** → `perform/1` returns `:ok` (the
       `:sent` terminal), receipt captured.
    3. **`adapter.deliver/2 -> {:error, reason}`** → `perform/1` returns
       `{:error, reason}` (retriable within `max_attempts`), provably NOT `:sent`.

  **Invariant D1 (lifecycle):** a lifecycle email reaches `:sent` ⟺ a *configured*
  adapter returned `{:ok, _}`. There is NO code path from an unconfigured/failed
  adapter to `:sent`.

  ## Configuration

      config :samen_core, Samen.Delivery.Lifecycle.EmailWorker,
        adapter: MyApp.Delivery.Esp,
        adapter_config: %{api_key: ..., endpoint: ...}

  When `:adapter` is absent the resolution is env-dependent (identical to the
  marketing worker): `:test` falls back to `Samen.Delivery.LocalSink`; any other
  env falls back to `nil` (unconfigured → `:blocked`). The active env is
  `Application.get_env(:samen_core, :delivery_env)` defaulting to the compiled
  `Mix.env()` — release-safe (Mix is not consulted at runtime) and
  test-overridable. As a convenience, if this worker has no `:adapter` configured
  the resolver falls back to the marketing `SendWorker`'s configured adapter — a
  host that wired one delivery adapter gets lifecycle mail through it for free.
