defmodule Samen.Mailbox.Match do
  @moduledoc """
  CRM matching for the mailbox sync (spec §I1, T74): resolve a message's
  COUNTERPARTY address to the Person (and, through it, the Company) whose timeline
  the message belongs on.

  ## Matching a VAULTED address

  A CRM `Person`'s `emails` is vault-routed (`:pii_email`) — there is no plaintext
  email column anywhere to `WHERE` against (INV-1), so matching cannot be a SQL
  predicate. It runs through the SAME governed read seam every other surface uses:

    1. read the org's candidate people (org-pinned, BOUNDED by
       `config.max_match_candidates` — never an unbounded table scan);
    2. resolve them through `Samen.Api.PiiResolution.resolve/4` on the **tenant
       plane** (the org reads its OWN contacts' PII in clear — the tenant-as-owner
       rule; no reveal grant is minted and the vault is never touched directly);
    3. compare NORMALIZED addresses (trim + NFC + downcase, the same normalization
       `Samen.Auth.BlindIndex.normalize/1` uses so `" A@Ex.TEST "` matches
       `a@ex.test`).

  This module NEVER calls `Samen.Vault.reveal/3` and never unwraps a `%Masked{}`.
  If resolution comes back masked (an actor/plane that may not read the PII), the
  address simply does not match — the honest, fail-closed answer. A message with no
  match is still recorded, anchored to nothing; it is never attached to an
  arbitrary record.

  ## Fail-closed on AMBIGUITY (the T160 discipline)

  A match resolves ONLY when there is EXACTLY ONE candidate. Zero candidates is
  honest absence; TWO OR MORE candidates (two people in the org sharing a
  counterparty address, or two companies sharing a domain) is ALSO honest absence —
  an ambiguous match is NEVER resolved by guessing the first row. This mirrors
  `Samen.CRM.AccountLink`'s (T160) fail-closed shape exactly: a vaulted body is
  threaded onto a record only when the org's own data points at ONE unambiguous
  contact/company, never onto an arbitrary-first guess.

  ## Company

  Precedence: the matched person's `company_id` first (the authoritative CRM link),
  then the counterparty address's DOMAIN against `Company.domain` — a plain,
  non-PII column, so the domain fallback is an ordinary org-scoped query.
