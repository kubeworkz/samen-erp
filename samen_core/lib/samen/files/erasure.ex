defmodule Samen.Files.Erasure do
  @moduledoc """
  The **file-blob erasure arm** (ADR-046 §4.3 · D4) — the arm that makes crypto-shred
  reach raw stored file bytes.

  `Samen.Erasure.shred/2` is a key-destruction job: it makes every *vaulted* value for a
  subject undecryptable at once. But a stored file **blob** is raw bytes in object storage
  — it lives OUTSIDE the per-subject-DEK envelope, so key-shred does not reach it (the same
  class of residue as the `non_pii!` plaintext carve-out). This module is that carve-out's
  erasure arm: on shred of a subject it locates the subject's `File` rows and deletes their
  blobs through the governed, ref-counted, fail-honest `Samen.Files.delete_file/3`
  chokepoint — so an erased subject's file bytes are actually removed.

  ## Last-reference-aware (T130)

  Because `Samen.Clone` re-links `storage_key` verbatim, an erased subject's file may share
  a blob with a NON-erased clone in another context. Deletion rides
  `Samen.Files.delete_file/3`, whose reference count destroys the physical blob ONLY when
  the LAST referencing row is gone — so erasing one subject NEVER destroys a blob a
  non-erased clone still references, and the blob IS removed once the final reference goes.

  ## Uploaded-BY *and* about-A subject (ADR-046 §7 decision #5)

  The arm reaches a subject's blobs through a domain **subject-field** — a column on the
  `File`-like resource that carries a data-subject id. This is deliberately NOT limited to
  `uploaded_by_id` ("a blob *uploaded BY* the subject"): it equally covers a domain
  subject-FK naming a data subject the blob is *ABOUT* — e.g. `CRM.Attachment.person_id`,
  where the blob may be that person's scanned ID or signed contract. A person's
  right-to-be-forgotten reaches documents *about* them, so shredding that `Person` deletes
  their `person_id`-linked attachment blobs through the SAME governed, ref-counted, audited
  `delete_file/3` path (last-reference-aware — a blob a non-erased row still references
  survives, T130). The completeness gate (`Samen.Erasure.Completeness`) treats such a
  subject-FK `storage_key` resource as GATED (it MUST have an arm); a genuinely org-owned
  blob with no subject FK (CMS `Media`) stays an org-lifecycle residual, not a per-subject
  arm.

  ## Retention-hold exception (the safety valve — fail-honest)

  A subject's right-to-be-forgotten can be legitimately overridden by a legal/retention
  obligation (a document the org must retain). So a spec MAY carry an optional
  `:hold?` predicate — `(row -> boolean)` — and any blob for which it returns `true` is
  **NOT deleted**; instead the arm records the delete was SKIPPED under hold
  (`%{blob_deleted: false, held: true}` in the per-file result, tallied as
  `"holds_skipped"` in the report). This is fail-honest in both directions: a held blob is
  never silently deleted (the hold is respected + visible in the report/audit), and an
  un-held blob is never silently kept (absent a hold predicate every matched blob IS
  deleted). No schema column is required — the predicate reads the row as read (all of the
  resource's attributes are selected), so a host keys the hold on whatever field encodes
  its retention policy (a `legal_hold` flag, a `retained_until` timestamp, …).

  ## Spec-driven, framework-first (the registry)

  The kernel does not know a host's `File` resource modules, so the arm is expressed as a
  list of specs the host registers (`config :samen_core, :file_erasure_specs`), exactly
  like the retention and rollup-erasure spec registries. Each spec is a map:

      %{
        file_module:    MyApp.PrimitivesScope.File,  # the File resource
        subject_field:  :uploaded_by_id,             # column carrying the subject id
                                                     # (or a domain subject-FK, e.g. :person_id)
        hold?:          fn row -> row.legal_hold end, # optional retention-hold predicate
        storage:        Samen.Files.Storage.Local,   # optional; default Local
        storage_config: %{root: "/var/lib/app/files"} # optional; default %{}
      }

  Absent any spec the arm is a no-op (returns `[]`) — a host that has not registered file
  erasure is unchanged, exactly as `Samen.NonPii` redacts nothing until a column is
  registered. The erasure-completeness verifier (ADR-046 §6) asserts every subject-linked
  `storage_key` column has such an arm, so a future one cannot ship unregistered; the specs
  are DERIVED per host by `Samen.Erasure.default_specs/1`, so a fresh `gen.app` covers its
  about-a-subject blobs by construction.

  ## Fail-soft inside the erasure transaction

  Called as a step inside `Samen.Erasure.shred/2`'s transaction, this arm is **fail-soft**:
  a single file whose blob cannot be deleted (e.g. an unconfigured S3 adapter) is RECORDED
  as an error in the arm's report but never rolls back the subject's vault erasure — the
  subject's key is already destroyed; a raw blob that could not be reached is an honest
  residue for the operator to retry, not a reason to abort the crypto-shred. Each
  per-file delete runs in its own savepoint (`Samen.Files.delete_file/3`'s transaction),
  so its rollback on a blob-delete failure is contained.

  Delete the blobs of `subject_id`'s files across every registered file-erasure spec.

  `repo` is the erasure transaction's repo (the per-file governed delete runs in a

    * `:file_specs` — override the registered specs (tests pass this).
    * `:org_id`     — the subject's org, for the blob-delete audit attribution.
