# WS-D D6 — the FLAGSHIP generative proof (AC-X-1).
#
# The north-star claim of the whole workstream (design.md §"North star"): `mix samen.gen.app`
# emits a RUNNING product — web + API + seeds + observability — that is correct-by-construction
# from zero, the way pawchart is, WITHOUT a single hand-edit. A green that only asserts "ci.sh
# exits 0" cannot prove that: the running surfaces could be dead weight, the gate could be
# toothless, the seeds could bypass the vault, the observability could leak SQL text. This probe
# binds the claim to real behaviour, end to end, in ONE automated run:
#
#   1. GENERATE a fresh app with the FULL running product (web + api + seeds + observability,
#      all default-ON) PLUS `--modules files,search,csv,settings` (WS-E: the four ≈0-LOC
#      framework end-user surfaces + the Samen.UI menu landing), into a project-local scratch
#      dir, using FRESH registry-safe abbrevs.
#   2. deps.get + `mix compile --warnings-as-errors` (via Gen.compile_and_dump!/1, which also
#      dumps the schema.dict + api_contract.v1.json baselines) — ZERO hand-edits.
#   3. Run the generated app's FULL ci.sh — the entire verifier gate (19 steps incl.
#      api_contract + ai_prompt_masking), the generated test suite (incl. the gen'd red-paths: record_vault,
#      the bounded/clamp/allowlist API red paths, the seeds vault-routing red path), and the
#      per-resource anti-tautology probe. It must PASS (exit 0).
#   4. SEED it via the emitted `mix <app>.seed` task, and confirm the seeds ran (the task
#      prints the seeded org id; the seeded 🔒 secrets are proven vault-routed by the gen'd
#      seeds_vault_test that step 3 already ran, and re-verified here by a raw-row scan).
#   5. BOOT it — start the supervision tree in :test-with-repo mode (real pool, endpoint
#      server:true on a scratch port) and assert over real HTTP:
#        * /healthz              → 200 "ok"          (liveness)
#        * /                     → 200                (the emitted landing page)
#        * /billing?org=…        → 200                (a framework-mounted LiveView)
#        * /notifications?org=…  → 200                (the WS-A inbox)
#        * /operator/accounts    → 200                (the ADR-010 operator plane)
#        * /assets/samen_ui.css  → 200                (the UI kit via samen_web priv)
#        * /files · /search · /settings · /csv/import/record → 200  (WS-E --modules surfaces)
#        * /                     → the Samen.UI HomeLive MENU listing every mounted surface
#        * /api/v1/records       → key-less FAIL-CLOSED (no leak); tenant key → 200 with data;
#          the un-allowlisted vault secret + org boundary NEVER appear (deny-by-default).
#   6. TWO SABOTAGES binding the new surfaces to real correctness (non-vacuity):
#        (a) delete a `show_fields` entry from the authored resource → the generated app's
#            `samen.verify.api_contract` step MUST flip to FAIL; revert → green again.
#        (b) drop `db_statement: :disabled` from the wired observability config → the
#            generated app's `no_plaintext_pii` tier MUST flip to FAIL; revert → green again.
#      Both reverts are byte-exact; both flips are proven (a probe whose sabotage cannot flip
#      is a tautology and halts non-zero).
#
# Zero scratch residue: the scratch app is removed and the committed abbrev registry is
# restored BYTE-EXACT from a scratch/tmp copy on every exit path (success, failure, crash) —
# and the restore is ASSERTED byte-equal (the probe fails loudly rather than leave residue).
#
# REGISTRY SAFETY (the D2/D3 gate carry): this probe NEVER treats the committed
# samen_core/priv/abbrev_registry.json as its own working copy. The pristine bytes are
# snapshotted to a scratch/tmp file FIRST; the reserve then writes the app's abbrevs into the
# physical registry (unavoidable — the generated app's `use Samen.Resource` reads
# `:code.priv_dir(:samen_core)` at ITS compile time), and the physical file is restored from
# the scratch copy on exit. The scratch copy is the source of truth for the restore.
#
# T107 (interrupt hardening): both the scratch app dir and the registry snapshot are now
# created via real OS `mktemp`/`mktemp -d` (unique-per-run, collision-immune by construction
# — a pre-planted stray file with a colliding-shaped name cannot break the run, unlike the
# old nanosecond-timestamp naming). A `:sigterm` trap (`System.trap_signal/3`) runs `cleanup.()`
# for defense-in-depth when this probe is invoked directly (outside ci.sh). NOTE: `:sigint` is
# NOT trappable inside the BEAM (`System.trap_signal/3` has no :sigint clause) — the
# AUTHORITATIVE interrupt backstop for both SIGINT and SIGTERM is the OS-level snapshot+trap
# wrapper in root `ci.sh` (`run_gen_probe`), which restores the registry byte-exact regardless
# of whether this process gets a chance to run its own cleanup at all.
#
# Run:  cd samen_core && mix run priv/gen_app_flagship_probe.exs
# Exit: 0 only if the FULL running product generated with zero hand-edits, its ci.sh passed,
#       it seeded + booted + served every route, and BOTH sabotages flipped the gate and
#       reverted byte-exact with zero residue.
