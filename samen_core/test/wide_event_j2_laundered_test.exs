  @moduledoc """
  T2.7 (b) — prove J2 catches the laundered leak C3 documents as an expected miss.

  The layered privacy design (plan C3 + J2; doc §runs 4a/4b):

    * **Direct leak → C3 AST.** `Logger.info(patient.full_name)` is a syntactic
      flow of a pii field into a sink — caught by `Samen.PiiReads`.
    * **Laundered leak → J2 sink schema.** A pii value passed THROUGH a helper
      first (`log_it(patient.full_name)`) is an opaque local at the sink call —
      a pure AST match MISSES it (the `Corpus.Laundered` LA1–LA3 fixture set,
      already an expected-miss in the pii_reads corpus). J2 closes that path at
      the SINK: every wide-event/span field must be a bounded ID/token/enum/number,
      so a laundered name has NOWHERE TO LAND.

  This test proves both halves against the SAME fixture:

    1. C3 misses the laundered corpus (only a `:laundered_hint` advisory) — the
       documented expected miss.
    2. J2 (the schema check + the runtime WideEvent validation) rejects a laundered
       plaintext name trying to occupy a wide-event field. There is no `:string`
       field, and the runtime rejects a name-shaped value in every bounded field —
       so the laundered name that got past C3 cannot reach the sink typed.
