  # Agent-authoring eval (T6.3, plan §7 Phase 6)

  The vision doc's "why it's the substrate for software an agent builds"
  (`docs/samen-foundry.txt` :921–:923): an agent asked to build a SaaS off a
  blank schema *invents* a users table, guesses a type, pastes an email into a
  free-text column. **Samen removes the blank page.** The catalog is ground the
  agent grounds on and can't invent off of; the fail-closed verifier gate is the
  agent's correctness oracle — a hallucinated column fails the build, net-new PII
  is caught by `pii_classify`.

  This is a **runnable eval** that puts that claim under test. It models "an agent
  authored these resource changes" and APPLIES each seeded change to a scratch
  host (the `SamenCore.TestRepo` fixture DB, in-sandbox, or a project-local scratch
  source dir), then asserts the **gate's exact exit behavior** — using the SAME
  `check/*` / `violations/*` / `scan/*` entry points each `mix samen.verify.*` task
  runs immediately before `Samen.Verifier.halt_if_violations/2`.

  The exit contract (`Samen.Verifier.halt_if_violations/2`) is precisely:

      violations == []  →  banner + exit 0   (the agent's change PASSES the gate)
      violations != []  →  print   + halt(1) (the gate CATCHES the agent's wrong)

  So `violations == []` is a deterministic proxy for exit 0, and a non-empty list
  is a deterministic proxy for exit 1. For case 2 we ALSO drive a real
  `System.cmd/3` child OS process to observe the true `:erlang.halt(1)` exit code
  end-to-end (the moduledoc of `Samen.Verifier` names this as the faithful way to
  assert the exit code without terminating the test VM).

  ## The scoring rubric (`@rubric`)

  Each seeded case names: the authored wrong, the OWNING verifier, the expected
  gate exit, and a substring the diagnostic must carry so the agent gets an
  *actionable* correctness signal (not just a red light). A case SCORES `:pass`
  iff the owning verifier produced the expected exit AND the diagnostic named the
  offending item. The final test asserts every case scored `:pass` — the eval's
  own gate.

  | # | seeded wrong (what the agent got wrong)                  | owning verifier         | expect |
  |---|---------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
  | 1 | a CORRECT new resource (vaulted PII, guarded FK, no leak)| the whole gate          | exit 0 |
  | 2 | a hallucinated / uncatalogued column                    | catalog_parity          | exit 1 |
  | 3 | net-new plaintext PII (`attribute :ssn, :string`)       | pii_classify            | exit 1 |
  | 4 | an unprefixed physical column                           | prefixes                | exit 1 |
  | 5 | a vault value logged OUTSIDE a `:reveal` action         | pii_reads               | exit 1 |
  | 6 | a `belongs_to` FK with no `SameOrgFk` guard             | same_org_fk             | exit 1 |

  These 6 red paths (cases 2–6 must-fail, case 1 must-pass) ARE the eval's red
  paths per the task spec.

  ## Anti-tautology probe (HARD RULE §2)

  Run this session in a project-local scratch backup
  (`samen_core/tmp/agent_eval_scratch/`, git-ignored, removed after). I sabotaged
  ONE gate step — `Mix.Tasks.Samen.Verify.PiiClassify.check/3` — to always return
  `[]` (the fail-open bug an agent's oracle must never have). **Observed:** eval
  case 3 (net-new plaintext PII) FLIPPED from `:pass` (caught) to `:fail`
  (uncaught) — the exact "the oracle stopped catching" outcome the task requires —
  while cases 1/2/4/5/6 stayed green (proving the sabotage was surgical, not a
  blanket break). **Reverted:** the file is byte-identical to the original and case
  3 catches again. The scratch dir was removed. Result stated in the T6.3 report.

  Every "caught" assertion below also carries a NON-VACUOUS positive control (case
  1 proves the same verifier passes a correct resource), so a red path can never
  pass by the verifier being always-fail.
