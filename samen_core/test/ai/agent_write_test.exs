  ADR-047 batch A4 — the write surface: **propose-then-approve** (§5.3; ADR-043 §6.2
  ratified **unamended** at §9#1).

    * **RP-AG-5 (write-never-executes)** — no path from an agent turn to a mutating
      governed action without an approve event by a distinct human, with the
      approve-then-execute POSITIVE CONTROL. Sabotage 250 (the write executes inline with
      agent authority) flips the named red here.
    * **Execution authority is the APPROVER's** — never the agent's, never the AI service
      principal's. The AI principal is the requester, is refused as a decider at BOTH the
      policy layer and the `<abbrev>_distinct_party` DB CHECK, and holds no write path.
    * **Approval of proposal X executes exactly X** — the sha256 args digest committed on
      the token-only turn row BEFORE the approval opened binds the proposal stored in the
      run's DEK envelope. A mutated/substituted payload at execution time REFUSES and
      rolls the decision back. Sabotage 252 drops the binding.
    * **Provenance is token-only** — the approval row carries `{org, kind, subject_ref,
      requested_by, deadline}` and a NIL reason; arg values live only inside the vault.
      Sabotage 253 puts the raw args on the approval.
    * **The recursion guard is LIVE** — an approved execution (and an inline read tool)
      cannot start a nested agent run: `:depth_exceeded`, enforced by an AMBIENT marker so
      omitting a `:depth` argument does not route around it. Sabotage 254 drops the marker.
    * **The four-way intersection still narrows** for write tools, and is RE-RESOLVED at
      execution — a tool de-declared while the approval sat pending refuses.
    * **Fail-honest budgets** — a proposal bills no tool call (nothing executed); the
      approved execution bills exactly one.

  Anti-tautology: every red assertion is paired with a positive control.
