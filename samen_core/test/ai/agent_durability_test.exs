  ADR-047 batch A2 — durability, idempotency, breakers, erasure:

    * `start/4` creates the `:queued` cursor and enqueues the FIRST TurnWorker job in
      the SAME transaction (the EventCapture idiom) — a rolled-back start leaves NO run
      row and NO job (proven by literal rollback); job args are token-only (F2.1);
    * the worker executes turn BATCHES (`turns_per_job/0`) and re-arms; a full drain
      runs a multi-turn goal to its terminal state with the SAME masked-only payloads;
    * **restart safety (RP-AG-7)**: a worker process KILLED mid-turn (after the
      `:proposed` decision checkpoint, inside the provider call) leaves a resumable
      cursor; the replay REUSES the `{run_id, turn_index}` row — exactly one row per
      index, stamped `meta: %{"replayed" => true}` — and never re-executes a completed
      turn (sabotage 242 flips the named tests here);
    * **never-nil `next_turn_at` watchdog**: a stalled run (dead job, elapsed window)
      is re-selected by the AshOban `:agent_turn_due` due-scan and driven to terminal;
      a run whose window has not elapsed is NOT selected (positive/negative pair;
      sabotage 243 flips the named test);
    * **kill-switch (fail-closed)**: switch on ⇒ new runs refuse honestly with NOTHING
      persisted, and an in-flight run stops at the NEXT turn boundary (sabotage 244);
      re-arming is explicit-operator-only;
    * **rate trip (§9#3 TAKEN)**: crossing the runs-per-org-hour threshold refuses the
      crossing run AND throws the same operator kill (reason `:rate_tripped`);
    * **provider trip**: consecutive normalized provider errors park the agent
      definition; a success resets the streak; re-arm restores;
    * **vault-routed transcript (§7.4; §9#2/#4 TAKEN)**: the transcript at rest is a
      `vt_*` token inside the DEK envelope (proven at the PHYSICAL row), revealed only
      through the one chokepoint; `Samen.Erasure.shred/2` reaches it (reveal
      `{:error, :shredded}`), a shredded mid-flight run refuses honestly, and the
      DERIVED 90-day retention `:shred` arm sweeps an expired run's DEK
      (sabotage 245 flips the erasure-arm tests);
    * **`AgentCase.leaks?/2` map/jsonb arm is non-vacuous**: a canary inside a
      persisted jsonb `meta` value IS detected (red-path), with clean controls.

  Anti-tautology: every red assertion is paired with a positive control.
