  ADR-047 batch A3 — the tool surface: read tools + EG2 scrubbing.

      `tool_schema/0` opt-in (default `:not_a_tool`) ∩ the agent definition's declared
      list ∩ the owner actor's policy envelope. One red per arm, each with a positive
      control; NO shipped ADR-039 action is a tool (proven over all 8). Sabotage 249
      (allowlist escape) flips the arm-3 red here.
    * **EG2 half one — tool DEFS (§4.2, RP-AG-1)**: defs ride `%MaskedPayload{}.tools`,
      scrubbed by `safe_metadata?/1` AND membership-checked against the byte-exact
      static `tool_schema/0` constants — a runtime-composed or canary-bearing def
      REFUSES `{:error, :pii_egress_refused}`. Sabotage 246 flips the reds here.
    * **EG2 half two — call echo + result re-entry (§4.3, RP-AG-2/RP-AG-3)**: echo +
      results re-enter ONLY as `ToolResult`-rendered, PiiResolution-EGRESS-resolved
      binaries through `:history`; vault-routed fields render `••••` on the AI plane
      (refutable: the tenant-plane NON-egress control genuinely resolves plaintext);
      `safe_segment?/1` is the fail-closed last line (a raw structured history entry
      refuses). Sabotages 247 (raw re-entry) and 248 (egress-mode drop) flip the
      named tests here. Shipped sabotages 44/45 re-proven on the agent path: a
      model-emitted `vt_*` tool ARG is refused BEFORE execution.
    * **Governed execution**: the action runs AS the owner actor (arm 4 — OrgScope:
      a foreign org's record does not exist, RP-AG-10); every refusal is recorded
      honestly on the bounded turn row and fed back, never silently skipped.
    * **Live `max_tool_calls` exhaustion (§6, RP-AG-6)** — fail-honest terminal.
    * **The decision stamp (§4.1, RP-AG-7)** — tool_kind + arg key names + the
      validated-args sha256 digest committed on the `{run_id, turn_index}` row.
