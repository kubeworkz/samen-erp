  RP-AI-9 / RP-AI-10 (ADR-043 §3.4 / §10.2) — the PERMANENT mask-leak red-team, the runtime
  half of the `ai_prompt_masking` verifier tier (the structural half is
  `mix samen.verify.ai_prompt_masking`). T65 ESTABLISHES this standing CI gate; T72 EXTENDS it
  (more adversarial cases + full-DB canary seeding).

  It fires a known PII **canary** (a vault-routed 🔒 field on a real resource) through EVERY
  egress class the chokepoint governs and asserts the canary — plaintext AND its `vt_*` token
  — NEVER appears at any egress:

    * **EG1 completion prompt** — `:complete` seal → provider recording
      (`Provider.Fake.sent_payloads/0`, the honest-capture double);
    * **EG2 tool args + tool-result re-entry** — the STRUCTURED egress: tool args resolved
      from a vault-routed binding must arrive `••••` at the provider (asserted on the
      **:tenant** plane, whose own-org-clear read genuinely resolves the canary through the
      wired vault double — so only §6.1 egress mode masks it and the leg REFUTES), and
      hand-assembled tool args (arg tuple / keyword arg list / JSON-ish map / a tuple wrapping
      an un-rendered `%Masked{}`) are REFUSED fail-closed by the §3.2 step-3 scrub allowlist —
      the shape class a blocklist scrub silently egressed (sabotage 45);
    * **EG3 embedding input** — `:embed` seal REFUSES a vault-routed binding fail-closed
      (grants never unlock embedding, §7.2);
    * **EG4 MCP payload** — `:mcp` seal masks vault fields; grants never apply;
    * **EG5 committed fixtures** — this suite's own fixtures carry no raw token (asserted);
    * **EG6 logs / telemetry / errors** — a naive log line, a normalized adapter error, and a
      telemetry event carry no canary/`vt_` (the `%MaskedPayload{}` Inspect redaction + the
      payload-free refusal + the error normalization).

  Plus the load-bearing gates: the `grant_plaintext_egress` on/off behavior (§6.1), the
  multi-turn expired-grant re-scrub (§3.2a, RP-AI-10), fail-closed refusal of un-maskable
  content (RP-AI-2), and masked-on-every-plane (§6.1, stricter than the UI).

  **Sabotage-refutable** (the anti-tautology counterweight, `scripts/sabotages/`): neutralize
  the masker — e.g. drop the §3.2a history re-mask, or expose the vault token instead of
  `••••` — and a NAMED test here flips (the canary reaches an egress). The positive controls
  (`grant ON` egresses the canary; `assert_leak_detected!`) prove the refutations are not
  vacuous: the canary CAN reach the provider when the value layer permits it.
