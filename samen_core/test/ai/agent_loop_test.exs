  ADR-047 batch A1 — the agent loop core, keyless and tool-free:

    * N-turn history accumulates and re-scrubs through the chokepoint on EVERY turn
      (§3.2a engaged on the agent path; a `vt_*`-poisoned prior turn REFUSES fail-closed);
    * agent runs are masked-only categorically (`egress_opts/2` pins
      `grant_egress?: false` LAST — operator decision §9#2 TAKEN; RP-AG-3's property);
    * all budgets are fail-honest (RP-AG-6): exhaustion is a terminal `:budget_exhausted`
      with a bounded `error_kind`, NEVER a promotion of the last assistant turn —
      sabotage 240 flips the named red tests here;
    * `cancel/2` is durable and re-checked at EVERY turn boundary (RP-AG-8) — sabotage
      241 flips the named cancel tests here;
    * terminal-state honesty on provider error / unscripted (fail-honest, EG6-normalized);
    * NO text at rest: run + turn rows are token-only; the terminal log line is
      token-only (EG6);
    * org isolation on the run rows (RP-AG-10);
    * `Samen.AI.Provider.Scripted` honors the fail-honest adapter contract
      (ADR-014/024/026: unscripted work NEVER returns `{:ok, _}`).

  Anti-tautology: every red assertion is paired with a positive control in the same
