  ADR-046 §6 — the erasure-completeness CAPSTONE gate (`Samen.Erasure.Completeness` +
  `mix samen.verify.erasure_completeness`).

  `Samen.Erasure.shred/2` is a KEY-destruction job — a value living OUTSIDE the
  per-subject-DEK envelope is not reached by key destruction, so it needs an explicit
  erasure arm or a shredded subject's data survives. This gate DISCOVERS every such
  residue from the LIVE schema (never `schema.dict`, which grandfathers) and ASSERTS a
  registered subject_id-keyed arm reaches each.

  Proven here, with anti-tautology positive controls:

    * DISCOVERY is real + non-vacuous — the fixture residue set contains ≥ the two hard
      classes (a `_bidx` derived-linkable column AND a `storage_key` column), and PHYSICAL
      (abbrev-prefixed) columns are resolved, not logical names.
    * PASSES on the fully-registered tree — every residue reached by a derived spec.
    * FAILS per-class when an arm is removed — drop the bidx spec → the email_bidx residue
      is named UNREACHED (positive control: with the spec it passes); drop the file spec →
      the storage_key residue is named UNREACHED.
    * FAILS on an UNREGISTERED `_bidx` column — the structural backstop catches a future
      blind index not in `Samen.DerivedLinkable`.
    * FAILS CLOSED on empty discovery — an empty derived-linkable OR storage_key set is a
      broken verifier, never a pass.
    * ACTIVATION — `default_specs/1` derives the correct subject-keyed arms from the live
      schema, and `install_default_specs/1` registers them so the arms actually fire.
