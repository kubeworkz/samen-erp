  T84b — `Samen.Fleet.Resolution.resolve/3` (ADR-044 §16.2 cockpit-side name
  resolution) and its reference `resolve_via_org_scan/5` seam.

  `resolve/3` itself is generic (fail-closed to `%{}`, filters a permissive/
  leaky seam back down to the requested handle set). `resolve_via_org_scan/5`
  is the load-bearing PROOF that name resolution can be composed from
  `Samen.Fleet.Handle.matches?/4` (product-local, keyless-to-the-cockpit) +
  `scope_of/2` (the SAME answer that gates tier-2 visibility, §16.2) without
  ever exposing the HMAC key itself.
