# scripts/sabotage.sh — WS-E E2i.1 sabotage harness (gate automation).
#
# Replays every SHIPPED gate sabotage as a committed patch and proves each still
# FLIPS its named tests — the standing anti-tautology ritual of the E1.4/E2.3
# (and every earlier) adversarial gate, converted from by-hand judgment into
# permanent infrastructure. For each scripts/sabotages/*.patch:
#
#   1. SHA-256 every file the patch touches (the byte-exact baseline),
#   2. apply the patch (git apply),
#   3. run `mix test <TEST_FILES>` in the patch's APP — the run MUST fail,
#   4. every MUST_FAIL substring MUST appear among the failed-test headers
#      (the named tests flipped — not just "something broke"),
#   5. revert (git apply -R) and re-SHA — byte-exact restore, zero residue.
#
# Patch metadata lives in `# KEY: value` header lines inside each .patch
# (git apply ignores everything before the first `diff --git`):
#   APP:        the app dir to run tests in (samen_core | samen_web | ...)
#   TEST_FILES: space-separated test files (relative to APP) that hold the named tests
#   MUST_FAIL:  a substring of a test name that MUST be among the failures (repeatable)
#
# ── SELECTION / FILTER MODES (additive; DEFAULT no-arg run is UNCHANGED) ──────
# With no flags this replays ALL patches, in filename order, exactly as before.
# Flags narrow the set — a FILTERED run certifies ONLY its subset; total
# coverage still requires a full (unfiltered) run, which at 212 patches exceeds
# the 600s single tool-call ceiling and so must be run BACKGROUNDED or in
# `--app`/`--range` CHUNKS (see docs/adr/ADR-045 §4.2). Filters COMPOSE as an
# intersection.
#   --app <name>            only patches whose APP: header == <name>
#   --range <lo>-<hi>       only patches whose FILENAME number (the NNN in
#   --from <lo> --to <hi>     NNN-slug.patch — stable, matches how we say
#                             "sabotage 205") is in [lo,hi] INCLUSIVE. --from/
#                             --to are an alternate spelling; a lone --from is
#                             lo..∞, a lone --to is 0..hi.
#   --touching <path>...    only patches whose touched-file set (the +++ b/…
#   --touching-file <file>    paths) INTERSECTS the given repo-relative paths
#                             (or the newline-separated paths in <file>).
#   --changed [<ref>]       derive the touched set from the UNION of `git diff
#                             --name-only <ref>` and `git ls-files --others
#                             --exclude-standard` (default ref: origin/main if it
#                             exists, else HEAD~1) — "certify the sabotages
#                             relevant to my diff". Selects patches touching any
#                             changed file. The untracked half is LOAD-BEARING:
#                             `git diff` never lists new files, so without it a
#                             batch that ADDS a module + its sabotages selects
#                             NONE of them (the A3 247/248/249 miss). The banner
#                             says `changed=<ref>+untracked` so the union is
#                             visible in the run's own output.
#   --list, --dry-run       print the SELECTED patch set (name + resolved APP,
#                             and the count) and EXIT — no patch is applied and
#                             no test runs. Fast proof of what a filter will run.
#
# The header preflight (scripts/sabotage_lint.sh) ALWAYS runs over ALL patches,
# even on a filtered run: a missing APP/TEST_FILES/MUST_FAIL header anywhere is
# a latent bug (the "patch 67 missing header aborts silently" class), so it is
# checked regardless of which subset was selected.
#
# A filtered run's success line is deliberately DISTINCT from the full-harness
# line so a partial run can never be mistaken for full certification, e.g.
#   SABOTAGE HARNESS: ALL PASSED (97 of 212 sabotages — FILTERED: app=samen_web)
# vs the full-run line:
#   SABOTAGE HARNESS: ALL PASSED (212 sabotages flipped their named tests; byte-exact restores)
#
# Wiring: a permanent OPT-IN root ci.sh step, gated by SAMEN_SABOTAGE=1 (the
# WS-D generative probes run unconditionally; this one deliberately breaks the
# tree and re-runs targeted suites, so it is opt-in — gates run it explicitly).
# ci.sh invokes it with NO flags → the full run, unchanged. Direct invocation
# runs regardless of the env var.
#
# Later gates: add the new sabotage as a .patch here (headers + git diff),
# re-run this harness, and spend gate judgment ONLY on new vacuity hunting.
#
# Needs: local Postgres (the targeted suites are DB-backed). Exits non-zero on
# the first sabotage that fails to flip, fails to name its tests, or leaves
# residue — and on an unknown flag or an empty selection.
